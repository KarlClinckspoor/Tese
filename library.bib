abstract = {The molecular constitution of viscoelastic gels is customarily described in terms of networks, which may have a transient or permanent character. Such supermolecular structures are often observed in biological or macromolecular systems, but can even occur in dilute solutions of some detergents. Surfactant molecules in solution, under suitable conditions, assemble reversibly into large aggregates of rod-like geometry. Depending on the ionic strength of the solution, these particles may be completely stiff or semiflexible. At low concentrations, when the lengths of the rods are much smaller than their mean distance of separation, there exists a sol state which is highly sensitive to shear forces. At higher surfactant concentrations, where the lengths of the rod shaped micelles become comparable to their mean distance, one observes gel formation and the solutions exhibit pronounced elastic properties. In analogy to polymer systems, these elongated, rod shaped micelles are strongly entangled; this leads to complicated flow processes. In comparison to solutions of macromolecules, there is, however, one important difference. The anisometric aggregates of sur-face active compounds are in tbermal equilibrium with single monomers. The permanent exchange of surfactant molecules leads to breaking and reformation processes of the rod shaped aggregates. These kinetic processes cause thermal fluctuations, which result in a finite lifetime of the anisometric micelles. In situations where the elongated micelles are breaking within the time scale of observation, the rheological properties are controlled by kinetic processes. It is just under these circumstances, that we obtain very simple scaling laws and linear relations between all rheological quantities. From a theoretical point of view, this corresponds to an ideal case, which is rarely observed in other types of associ-ation colloids. The viscoelastic surfactant solutions can therefore be used as simple model systems for studies of fundamental principles of flow. The basic ideas and concepts have a general, universal character which leads to a deeper insight into dynamic properties and rheological mechanisms.},

abstract = {In the present work a series of fluorinated quaternary ammonium salts were synthesized in two steps. The physical properties of the obtained surfactants were characterized by DLS, zeta potential, viscosity, and Cryo-SEM. The surfactants with a long fluorinated chain form long and highly flexible aggregates that lead to highly viscous solutions and the formation of an entangled network made of flexible worm-like micelles. The viscoelastic properties of the surfactants that form hydrogels without any additives were characterized along with zeta potential and Cryo-SEM observations. They present a maximum viscosity as a function of worm-like micelles formation. The increase of the fluorinated and hydrocarbon chain lengths contributes to the enhancement of this viscoelastic behavior.},

Crystals appeared as flat needles or plates depending upon the kind of complex and condition of crystallization. These complexes were analyzed and found to be either binary complexes of urea and a salt or ternary complexes containing water as the third component. Solubilities of urea in aqueous solutions containing these salts have been measured at 25°, and the phase diagrams of some ternary systems were determined.

abstract = {The interaction of biological macromolecules, whether protein– DNA, antibody–antigen, hormone–receptor, etc., illustrates the complexity and diversity of molecular recognition. The importance of such interactions in the immune response, signal transduction cascades, and gene expression cannot be overstated. It is of great interest to determine the nature of the forces that stabilize the interaction. The thermodynamics of association are characterized by the stoichiometry of the interaction (n), the association con- stant (Ka), the free energy ( Gb), enthalpy ( Hb), entropy ( Sb), and heat capacity of binding ( Cp). In combination with structural information, the energetics of binding can provide a complete dissection of the interaction and aid in identifying the most im- portant regions of the interface and the energetic contributions. Various indirect methods (ELISA, RIA, surface plasmon reso- nance, etc.) are routinely used to characterize biologically impor- tant interactions. Here we describe the use of isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) in the study of protein–protein interactions. ITC is the most quantitative means available for measuring the thermo- dynamic properties of a protein–protein interaction. ITC measures the binding equilibrium directly by determining the heat evolved on association of a ligand with its binding partner. In a single experiment, the values of the binding constant (Ka), the stoichi- ometry (n), and the enthalpy of binding ( Hb) are determined. The free energy and entropy of binding are determined from the association constant. The temperature dependence of the Hb parameter, measured by performing the titration at varying tem- peratures, describes the Cp term. As a practical application of the method, we describe the use of ITC to study the interaction between cytochrome c and two monoclonal antibodies.},

In both systems lecithin and water form disconnected cylindrical reverse micelles. The ternary phase map for the lecithin/water/isopropylpalmitate has been investigated in detail. The organogel exists in a narrow region close to the lecithin-oil binary axis; for higher water content equilibrium between lamellae and reverse micelles is found. Lamellar phase occupies the lecithin-rich region, close to the lecithin corner (with the exception of a small island of hexagonal phase) and coexists with neat water close to the water-lecithin axis. The remaining part of the phase map shows the three-phase coexistence of water, oil, and lamellar phase.},

abstract = {The structural behavior of surfactant micelles is studied. The micelles are considered as generally shaped as triaxial tablets with distinct thickness, width and length and they become spherical, spherocylindrical or disk-shaped depending on the dimensions. The micelle size is found to depend mainly on a constant k 1 , whereas another constant k 2  influences the shape. The two constants are related to the first and second order correction in curvature of the micellar end caps. Large positive k 2  values promote the formation of tablets rather than very long spherocylinders. An additional parameter related to the curvature of the straight cylindrical rims may influence the structure of the tablet-shaped micelles insofar k 2  is close to or below zero.},

abstract = {Some quaternary cationic surfactants, when mixed with a counterion, are known to self-assemble into threadlike micelles in water. Such behavior causes drastic changes in rheological properties of even very dilute solutions, allowing them to be used as drag reducing agents (DRA) in turbulent pipe flow circulating systems, such as district cooling/heating systems. Surfactant self-assembly is a physicochemical phenomenon whose character depends on surfactant nature and concentration, nature of the solvent, temperature and type and concentration of counterions. This study investigates drag reduction (DR) and rheological properties of two cationic surfactants, Ethoquad O/12 (oleyl bis(hydroxyethyl)methylammonium chloride) and Ethoquad O/13 (oleyl tris(hydroxyethyl) ammonium acetate), with excess salicylate counterion (NaSal), in mixed solvents containing 0 to 28 wt{\%} ethylene glycol (EG) and water. The addition of EG to the solvent had greater effects on solutions' DR ability, shear viscosity, apparent extensional viscosity and viscoelasticity at 25°C than at ∼0°C. Cryo-TEM images show threadlike micelle in these systems. DR at low temperatures in solutions containing moderate amount of EG can be utilized in a new approach to energy saving in district cooling systems using EG-water based mixtures as the cooling fluids. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {The nature and strength of the interactions between a cationic fluorophore, Rhodamine 123 (R123), and surfactants of different head charge are investigated. Series of absorption and fluorescence emission spectra and of fluorescence decays are measured. R123 does not interact with the monomers of both nonionic and cationic surfactants but it presents affinity to their micelles. A partition equilibrium model was proposed and the corresponding equilibrium constants were obtained, as well as the photophysical properties of the dye bound to the micelles. In the case of the cationic surfactants, changes of the fluorescence properties were already observed below the critical micellar concentration (CMC) due to dynamic quenching caused by the free counterions. In the presence of anionic surfactants R123 shows a very different behaviour with dramatic spectral changes below the CMC. The observed variations are attributed to a first, strong interaction between R123 and the surfactant monomers, which yields ionic pairs of singular photophysical properties and dominates at low surfactant concentrations, followed by the association of R123 with the surfactant premicellar and micellar aggregates at higher surfactant concentrations near the CMC. This behaviour results from the competition between the strong electrostatic interactions of the cationic dye with the anionic surfactant head groups and the hydrophobic forces stabilizing the dye inside the micelles. The results of this work illustrate the complex physicochemical and photophysical behaviour of a charged dye in micellar systems, which resembles the expected situation in similar systems such as biological membranes.},

abstract = {The co-evolution of a strong theoretical framework alongside application of a range of sophisticated experimental tools engendered rapid advancement in the study of “giant micelles.” Beginning with Anacker and Debye's 1951 experimental study of elongated micelles by light scattering and their subsequent theoretical inference that the thermodynamics of these structures would have to reflect an opposing force model, theory and experiment have progressed hand in hand. This progress, along with growing interest in the practical and industrial applications of these structures in cleansers, cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, and energy production, demands a comprehensive, single-source reference to the current state-of-the-science. Drawing on the expertise of internationally known scientists, Giant Micelles: Properties and Applications summarizes the range of behaviors encountered in solutions of micelles and their applications in industrial processes. The book introduces theoretical aspects of the rheological behavior and formation of giant micelles from different viewpoints including molecular-level thermodynamic theory and computer simulations. It continues by focusing on the results of a variety of experimental studies using methods such as cryo-transmission electron microscopy, scattering techniques, phase diagrams, linear and non-linear rheology, and chemical relaxation. Illustrating the properties of giant micelles on solid surfaces, the book also considers systems of smart micelles that respond to external stimuli by a change of shape. The authors describe giant micelles formed from amphiphilic block copolymers as well as non-covalent polymers that exhibit similar rheological behavior to giant micelles. Finally, the chapters address current and emerging applications of giant micelles in oil and gas production, drag reduction, drug-delivery formulations, and personal care products such as shampoo. By gathering a range of information into one volume, Giant Micelles: Properties and Applications provides scientists with an essential reference on these fascinating materials and their emerging role in industrial application.},

abstract = {The influence of excess NaCl on the properties of viscoelastic detergent solutions of Cetypyridiniumsalicylate (CPySal) has been studied by static and dynamic light scattering, electric birefringence and rheological measurements. It is obeserved that the rodlike micelles of length L which are present in these solutions and which are responsible for their elastic properties grow in length with the increase of the NaCl concentration. As long as the rods are shorter than their mean distance, their length can be determined from the rheological and electric birefringence measurements. For very small shear fields these solutions behave as Newtonian fluids. The viscosity of the solution increases strongly when the rods begin to overlap. Solutions with overlapping rods are elastic. It is postulated from the results that the cmcII(the critical concentration above which rods are present) and the length L of the rods are partially determined by the intermicellar interaction energy. It is furthermore postulated that this intermicellar interaction energy has an influence on the polydispersity of the rods and seems to make the rods relatively monodisperse. {\textcopyright} 1982.},

Characterization of the bicellar systems by dynamic light scattering (DLS) and cryogenic transmission electron microscopy (Cryo-TEM) showed that particle size decreased when DDEA was encapsulated and increased when Ffa was included in the bicellar systems. Percutaneous absorption studies demonstrated a lower penetration of DDEA and Ffa through the skin when the drugs were included in the bicellar systems than when the drugs were applied in an aqueous solution (DDEA) and in an ethanolic solution (Ffa); the reduction in penetration was more pronounced with Ffa.

However, this understanding does not always translate well to reactions on a synthetic scale because concentrations are typically very different from concentrations used in probe reactions. These high concentrations may lead to changes in aggregate morphologies, in particular where aromatic anions are used in combination with cationic surfactants.

abstract = {Cryptococcus neoformans is a fungal pathogen that is responsible for life-threatening disease, particularly in the context of compromised immunity. This organism makes extensive use of mannose in constructing its cell wall, glycoproteins, and glycolipids. Mannose also comprises up to two-thirds of the main cryptococcal virulence factor, a polysaccharide capsule that surrounds the cell. The glycosyltransfer reactions that generate cellular carbohydrate structures usually require activated donors such as nucleotide sugars. GDP-mannose, the mannose donor, is produced in the cytosol by the sequential actions of phosphomannose isomerase, phosphomannomutase, and GDP-mannose pyrophosphorylase. However, most mannose-containing glycoconjugates are synthesized within intracellular organelles. This topological separation necessitates a specific transport mechanism to move this key precursor across biological membranes to the appropriate site for biosynthetic reactions. We have discovered two GDP-mannose transporters in C. neoformans, in contrast to the single such protein reported previously for other fungi. Biochemical studies of each protein expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae show that both are functional, with similar kinetics and substrate specificities. Microarray experiments indicate that the two proteins Gmt1 and Gmt2 are transcribed with distinct patterns of expression in response to variations in growth conditions. Additionally, deletion of the GMT1 gene yields cells with small capsules and a defect in capsule induction, while deletion of GMT2 does not alter the capsule. We suggest that C. neoformans produces two GDP-mannose transporters to satisfy its enormous need for mannose utilization in glycan synthesis. Furthermore, we propose that the two proteins have distinct biological roles. This is supported by the different expression patterns of GMT1 and GMT2 in response to environmental stimuli and the dissimilar phenotypes that result when each gene is deleted.},

On further increasing Texapon N70-H mole fractions, the sequence of the phases is reversed again. In the L$\alpha$-phase, the rheological measurements show that the complex viscosities (|?*|, ? = 0.01 Hz) are much higher than those in viscous L1-phase, and furthermore show that the L$\alpha$-phase has a more or less frequency-independent storage modulus. Freeze-fracture electron micrograph results show that small unilamellar and multilamellar vesicles coexist in the L$\alpha$-phase.

It is also demonstrated that a classic L$\alpha$-phase as opposed to a vesicle phase is produced in the new cationic and anionic surfactant mixed solutions by a different preparation route in which the L$\alpha$-phase is prepared without shear by mixing a small amount of methyl formate to a L1-phase from C14DMAO and sodium dodecylethoxysulfate [CH3(CH2)11(CH2CH2O)2.5SO3Na, Texapon N70]. By this route, one obtains the stacked L$\alpha$-phase and no vesicles.

abstract = {Free fatty acids play a vital role as fuel for cells and in lipid metabolism. During lipid digestion in the gastrointestinal tract, triglycerides are hydrolyzed, resulting in free fatty acid and monoglyceride amphiphilic products. These components, together with bile salts, are responsible for the transport of lipids and poorly water-soluble nutrients and xenobiotics from the intestine into the circulatory system of the body. In this study, we show that the self-assembly of digestion products from medium-chain triglycerides (tricaprylin) in combination with bile salt and phospholipid is highly pH-responsive. Individual building blocks of caprylic acid within the mixed colloidal structures are mapped using a combination of small-angle X-ray and neutron scattering combined with both solvent contrast variation and selective deuteration. Modeling of the scattering data shows transitions in the size and shape of the micelles in combination with a transfer of the caprylic acid from the core of the micelles to the shell or into the bulk water upon increasing pH. The results help to understand the process of lipid digestion with a focus on colloidal structure formation and transformation for the delivery of triglyceride lipids and other hydrophobic functional molecules.},

abstract = {The wormlike micelles formed with the surfactant pentaoxyethylene decyl ether C10E5 containing n-dodecanol were characterized by static (SLS) and dynamic light scattering (DLS) experiments. The SLS results have been analyzed with the aid of the light scattering theory for micelle solutions, thereby yielding the molar mass Mw(c) as a function of concentration c along with the cross-sectional diameter d of the micelle. The observed Kc/DeltaR0 as a function of c and the hydrodynamic radius RH as functions of Mw have been well described by the theories for the wormlike spherocylinder model. It has also been demonstrated that the apparent hydrodynamic radius RH,app(c) as a function of c is well described by a fuzzy cylinder theory which takes into account the hydrodynamic and direct collision interactions among micelles. Our previous results for the hexaoxyethylene dodecyl ether C12E6 micelles containing n-dodecanol were reanalyzed in the same scheme. It has been found that the micellar length increases with increasing concentration c or with raising temperature T irrespective of the composition of the C10E5 + n-dodecanol and C12E6 + n-dodecanol systems. The length of the micelles at fixed c and T steeply increases with increasing weight fraction wd of n-dodecanol in both systems. The growth of the micelles accompanies the increase of the cross-sectional diameter d of the micelles and the results that the surfactant molecules are more densely assembled with increasing wd in order to keep n-dodecanol molecules inside the micelles.},

abstract = {We present a systematic investigation of the extent of compartmentalization in micelles formed by a series of bis-hydrophilic block terpolymers with two outer water-soluble segments. The corona blocks are constructed from poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) and the thermoresponsive poly(N-isopropyl-acrylamide) (PNiPAAm). The fraction of PNiPAAm is varied to establish its influence on the supramicellar aggregation and corona phase behavior. We demonstrate that--when the collapse of PNiPAAm is triggered--a clustering of micelles into superstructures only occurs when the contour length of the thermoresponsive block is longer than that of the PEO chains. The volume fractions play a minor role. The extent of superstructure formation increases with the amount of heating cycles, pointing to a rearrangement of micelles with a mixed corona into a phase-segregated corona. The collapse of PNiPAAm is exploited to artificially raise the incompatibility and drive phase segregation. A uniform population of biphasic Janus micelles cannot be obtained. After repeated heating cycles, the mixture consists of a range of multicompartment architectures, whose patch distribution can be derived from aggregate structures found in cryo-TEM obtained at high temperature. In the last section, we relate our results to previously studied systems and attempt to derive some generalities. First, we try to answer the question of how likely it is in terms of thermodynamics to obtain truly self-assembled Janus micelles. Furthermore, our results can provide an estimation for the volume ratio or/and block lengths required in micelles composed out of two corona blocks to induce supramicellar aggregation when a hydrophilic-to-hydrophobic phase transition is triggered in one of the blocks.},

abstract = {The Moon is key to understanding both Earth and our Solar System in terms of planetary processes and has been a witness of the Solar System history for more than 4.5 Ga. Building on earlier telescopic observations, our knowledge about the Moon was transformed by the wealth of information provided by Apollo and other space missions. These demonstrated the value of the Moon for understanding the fundamental processes that drive planetary formation and evolution. The Moon was understood as an inert body with its geology mainly restricted to impact and volcanism with associated tectonics, and a relative simple composition. Unlike Earth, an absence of plate tectonics has preserved a well-defined accretion and geological evolution record. However recent missions to the Moon show that this traditional view of the lunar surface is certainly an over simplification. For example, although it has long been suspected that ice might be preserved in cold traps at the lunar poles, recent results also indicate the formation and retention of OH-and H2O outside of polar regions. These volatiles are likely to be formed as a result of hydration processes operating at the lunar surface including the production of H2O and OH by solar wind protons interacting with oxygen-rich rock surfaces produced during micrometeorite impact on lunar soil particles. Moreover, on the basis of Lunar Prospector gamma-ray data, the lunar crust and underlying mantle has been found to be divided into distinct terranes that possess unique geochemical, geophysical, and geological characteristics. The concentration of heat producing elements on the nearside hemisphere of the Moon in the Procellarum KREEP Terrane has apparently led to the nearside being more volcanically active than the farside. Recent dating of basalts has shown that lunar volcanism was active for almost 3 Ga, starting at about 3.9-4.0 Ga and ceasing at ∼1.2 Ga. A recent re-processing of the seismic data supports the presence of a partially molten layer at the base of the mantle and shows not only the presence of a 330 km liquid core, but also a small solid inner core. Today, the Moon does not have a dynamo-generated magnetic field like that of the Earth. However, remnant magnetization of the lunar crust and the paleomagnetic record of some lunar samples suggest that magnetization was acquired, possibly from an intrinsic magnetic field caused by an early lunar core dynamo. In summary, the Moon is a complex differentiated planetary object and much remains to be explored and discovered, especially regarding the origin of the Moon, the history of the Earth-Moon system, and processes that have operated in the inner Solar System over the last 4.5 Ga. Returning to the Moon is therefore the critical next stepping-stone to further exploration and understanding of our planetary neighborhood. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The obtained results are compared with those reported in pure water for the corresponding mixed surfactant systems. The zero-shear viscosity first sharply increases with C12EO3 addition and then decreases; i.e., there is a viscosity maximum. The intensity (viscosity) and position (C12EO3 fraction) of this maximum shift to lower values upon an increase in the ratio of glycerol in the glycerol/water mixed solvent, while the position of the maximum changes in an opposite way with increasing formamide. In the case of the SDS/C12EO3 system, zero-shear viscosity shows a decrease with an increase of temperature, but for the ChEO15/C12EO3 system, again, the zero-shear viscosity shows a maximum if plotted as a function of temperature, its position depending on the C12EO3 mixing fraction. In the studied nonionic systems, worm micelles seem to exist at low temperatures (down to 0 degrees C) and high glycerol concentrations (up to 50 wt {\%}), which is interesting from the viewpoint of applications such as drag reduction fluids. Rheology results are supported by small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and dynamic light scattering (DLS) measurements on nonionic systems, which indicate micellar elongation upon addition of glycerol or increasing temperature and shortening upon addition of formamide. The results can be interpreted in terms of changes in the surface curvature of aggregates and lyophobicity.},

abstract = {Hypothesis It is known that additives like glycerol and sucrose lead to the swelling of aqueous bilayer L$\alpha$ phases. The swelling of the L$\alpha$ phases can be explained by the increase of the refractive index of the mixed solvent, which lowers the van der Waals attraction between the bilayers. Afterwards, the undulation forces between the bilayers can push them apart. This hypothesis was previously extended to wormlike micelles (WLM) of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) and sodium salicylate (NaSal). These types of self-assembly structures have viscoelastic properties, and the zero shear viscosity of these solutions is dependent on the molar ratio NaSal/CTAB, R. At R = 0.6, R = 1.0 and R ≈ 2.6 the viscosity goes, respectively, through a maximum, a minimum and another maximum. These viscosities can be explained by differences in relaxation mechanisms predominant in each region. Similarly to what is observed to bilayer L$\alpha$ phases, the additives would change the interaction between the WLM, affecting the relaxation processes of each region, altering the profile from two maxima and one minimum to a single maximum in viscosity. In the present manuscript, it is investigated whether it is only the refractive index, other solvent properties, or a combination of several factors that induce these changes in WLM. For this, several additives, forming binary mixtures with water, were studied, through rheology of CTAB/NaSal and calorimetry of tetradecyltrimethylammonium bromide (TTAB)/NaSal. Experiments Herein, we present the zero-shear viscosity diagrams of NaSal and CTAB with glycerol, sucrose, dimethyl sulfoxide, 1,3-butanediol and urea combined with water. Additionally, isothermal titration calorimetry was used to obtain the variations of enthalpy for formation of WLM of TTAB and NaSal in mixtures of water and such additives. Findings Based on our data, only the refractive index match is not enough to explain the rheological and calorimetric behaviors of the WLM. For instance, sucrose has little effect on the micelles, even at the same refractive index match conditions. Additional characteristics, such as dielectric constant, the cohesivity of the solvent (here symbolized by the Gordon parameter), and the interactions of the additive with the micelles, have to be considered to better describe the results.},

abstract = {The enthalpy of solution of propan-1-ol in water is a convenient and reliable calibration and test reaction in titration microcalorimetry. The solution enthalpy varies significantly with concentration; hence, it is usually necessary to make extrapolations to infinitely dilute solution to determine $\Delta$solHm∞ in order to derive a value suitable for comparison. We outline the thermodynamic formalism for the titration solution experiments and indicate an extrapolation procedure. An experimental example is given. Since less energetic test reactions are often desirable, the dilution of 10 wt.{\%} propan-1-ol solution in water has been suggested as such a reaction. Thus, we have made dilution measurements in order to explore the accuracy of the reported enthalpy value and found that the uncertainty is, at present, at least a couple of percent. Some experimental considerations when performing titration microcalorimetric experiments are discussed.},

This presentation will give an overview of the history, context and development of the ouzo effect, as well as recent advancements and ideas in the field.

abstract = {Dynamics of Surfactant Self-Assemblies explains the dynamics of micellar equilibria, tracking surfactant exchange, and micelle formation/breakdown processes. Highlighting the structural similarities of amphiphilic block copolymers to surfactants, this volume elucidates the dynamics of more complex self-assemblies that surfactants and amphiphilic block copolymers form in solutions. The book first discusses self-assembling processes taking place in aqueous surfactant solutions and the dynamic character of surfactant self-assemblies. The next chapter reviews methods that permit the study of the dynamics of self-assemblies. The dynamics of micelles of surfactants and block copolymers, solubilized systems, microemulsions, vesicles, and lyotropic liquid crystals/mesophases are reviewed successively. The authors point out the similarities and differences in the behavior of these different self-assemblies. Much emphasis is put on the processes of surfactant exchange and of micelle formation/breakdown that determine the surfactant residence time in micelles, and the micelle lifetime. The last three chapters cover topics for which the dynamics of surfactant self-assemblies can be important for a better understanding of observed behaviors: dynamics of surfactant adsorption on surfaces, rheology of viscoelastic surfactant solutions, and kinetics of chemical reactions performed in surfactant self-assemblies used as microreactors. Dynamics of Surfactant Self-Assemblies offers a unique and comprehensive review of the literature that exists on the dynamics of the various surfactant self-assemblies and a unified perspective on this topic. It provides researchers with a useful guide for the dynamics of the surfactant systems that they wish to investigate.},

Results showed that the observed rate constant of the two reactions varied when a sphere-to-rod transition occurs. This morphological transition is accompanied by changes in the interfacial region water content and in its polarity. The micellar ionization degree is also altered, making the counterion interfacial concentration change. Finally, variations on the molar surfactant volume, Vm, also follow the sphere-to-rod transitions. A simple pseudophase kinetic model is inadequate for quantitatively discussing the kinetic micellar effects observed, since the changes accompanying micellar growth affect the second-order rate constant in the micellar pseudophase, the equilibrium binding constant and the surfactant molar volume, neither of them remaining constant in the whole surfactant concentration range. However, this simple model can be helpful in the treatment of kinetic data for surfactant concentrations below the morphological transitions, providing some interesting, although approximate, information. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Inc.

Here, we first report branched worms formed by a C22-tailed amidosulfobetaine surfactant—3-(N-erucamidopropyl-N,N-dimethyl ammonium) propane sulfonate (EDAS). Increasing EDAS concentration in the semidilute region increases the viscosity by several orders of magnitude and forms viscoelastic micellar solution of entangled and branched worms. The intermicellar branching is proved by rheological methods and Cryo-TEM observation. Besides, the rheological experiments indicate that EDAS worms show some advantages such as low overlapping concentration, insensitive to inorganic salt, stable over the whole pH range.},

The errors that have held back the fields have most often been category errors, that is, errors with regard to the domain of knowledge within which a given observation is to be explained. For over a century the results of mixing colored lights were explained in terms of physics rather than in terms of the properties of human photoreceptors. Modern color science finds its birth in the seventeenth century. Before that time, it was commonly thought that white light represented light in its pure form and that colors were modifications of white light. It was already well known that passing white light through triangular glass prisms could produce colors, and the long thin prisms sold at fairs had knobs on the end so that they could be suspended close to a source of light. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier B.V.

The analysis of the deuterium modulation depth and the Fourier transformation of the two-pulse electron spin echo spectra show that urea interacts with the surfactant polar headgroups at the micelle surface. It is also found that nondeuterated urea exchanges 1 H with 2 H in SDS/D 2 O and DTAB/D2O and that the interaction strength of urea is greater with DTAB than SDS surfactant. These results support recent molecular dynamics and Monte Carlo calculations of micellar systems and are in agreement with direct interaction of urea at micellar surfaces in which it replaces some water molecules in the surface region. {\textcopyright} 1990 American Chemical Society.},

A significant advance was made through the two-species modeling approach originally proposed by Vasquez, Cook, and McKinley. In the present work we revisit their model from a nonequilibrium thermodynamic perspective. By employing an extension to the nonequilibrium treatment of chemical reaction kinetics for media with an internal structure, we develop a thermodynamic model that closely resembles the one based on more ad hoc assumptions. Thus, we not only validate that model, but now also have a mechanism to systematically produce further refinements.

abstract = {We study theoretically the effects of cross‐link formation in the entangled micellar phase of viscoelastic surfactant solutions. We consider equilibrium cross‐links, of energy E≫kBT, that can arise through local fusion of the micelles. For simplicity, we assume that the end‐cap energy is much larger than E, so that the system forms a network in which free ends can be neglected. We consider cases when the material between cross‐links is (i) a rigid rod, (ii) a Gaussian chain, and (iii) an excluded‐volume chain. In each case, we define a ‘‘saturated'' network as one for which L≂Lb, where L is the arc length between cross‐links and Lb that of a geometrical subunit or ‘‘blob'' of the network. (An ‘‘unsaturated'' network is, in contrast, one for which L≫Lb. ) In the rigid‐rod case we predict an unsaturated network at all concentrations. For flexible chains we predict that the network is unsaturated at high concentrations, but as the concentration is decreased, these systems should reach saturation, followed at lower ϕ by a phase separation between a dilute saturated network and excess solvent. Surprisingly, this phase separation should occur even for the case of a very good solvent: there is an entropy gain associated with creating threefold junction points which increases with dilution, and asymptotically overcomes any finite cross‐link energy E. In practice, however, this may often be unobservable due to the very small concentrations required, and/or the effects of free ends. We briefly discuss the possible implications of our results for the viscoelastic properties of surfactant solutions.},

abstract = {We investigated the phase behavior and the phase transitions in aqueous solutions of 100 mM cetyltrimethylammonium hydroxide (CTAOH) with 3-hydroxy- 2-naphthoic acid (HNC) and of 100 mM cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) with sodium-3-hydroxy-2-naphthoate (SHNC). The naphthoate/surfactant ratio has been varied. As previously observed by the groups of C. Manohar and J. Candau we observed for the second system two viscoelastic gel-like regions, two liquid crystalline regions, and a precipitate region. For the CTAOH/HNC system one finds with increasing concentration of HNC a low viscous solution, a viscoelastic gel, and a viscoelastic liquid crystalline L($\alpha$)-phase. In both surfactant systems the lamellar phase is formed around an equimolar ratio of cationic surfactant and naphthoate. The lamellar phases have been examined by polarization microscopy and freeze-fracture electron microscopy. The L($\alpha$)-phase in the system CTAOH/HNC consists of densely packed multilamellar vesicles while the lamellar phase in the system CTAB/SHNC contains vesicles, as well as stacked bilayers and tubuli. Corresponding to their different microstructures the lameliar phases in the system, CTAOH/HNC and CTAB/SHNC have different theological properties. The vesicular phase is highly viscoelastic and has a yield stress value while the bilayer phase has a much lower viscosity and no yield stress value. The transition from the micellar to the vesicle phase occurs for CTAOH/HNC over a two-phase region, where micelles and vesicles coexist. In the case of CTAB/SHNC the transition from the micellar to the lamellar phase occurs over a three-phase region, where a surfactant-poor phase coexists with a lamellar and a coacervate phase. In mixtures of CTAB and SHNC a thick precipitate is formed at an equimolar ratio of CTAB and SHNC. This precipitate consists of condensed multilamellar vesicles that contain little water and stick together, as the vesicles collapse due to the shielding of the repulsive forces by NaBr from an unbinding to a binding state. The precipitate can be retransformed to a swollen lameliar phase by charging the vesicles with an excess of ionic surfactant, by adding electrolyte in high concentrations, or by increasing the temperature. As predicted by C. Manohar et al. the vesicle phases show a phase transition at a critical temperature T(c) of 46°C. This transition was detected by us for the first time by DSC and by conductivity measurements. It occurs within a narrow temperature range of 2-3 degrees with an enthalpy change of 0.5 kJ/mol. The transition is observed both in the swollen and in the precipitated vesicle phase. It is well separated from the vesicle/rod transition at higher temperatures ({\textgreater}70°C) and the liquid crystalline/crystalline transition at lower temperatures (25-30°C) that has a melting enthalpy of 55 kJ/mol. It is conceivable that the observed transition at 46°C is due to the melting of a two-dimensional solid-like lattice of the HNC-counterions on the vesicle interface.},

abstract = {Giant micelles are elongated, polymer-like objects created by the self-assembly of amphiphilic molecules ( such as detergents) in solution. Giant micelles are typically flexible, and can become highly entangled even at modest concentrations. The resulting viscoelastic solutions show fascinating flow behaviour (rheology) which we address theoretically in this article at two levels. First, we summarize advances in understanding linear viscoelastic spectra and steady-state nonlinear flows, based on microscopic constitutive models that combine the physics of polymer entanglement with the reversible kinetics of self-assembly. Such models were first introduced two decades ago, and since then have been shown to explain robustly several distinctive features of the rheology in the strongly entangled regime, including extreme shear thinning. We then turn to more complex rheological phenomena, particularly involving spatial heterogeneity, spontaneous oscillation, instability and chaos. Recent understanding of these complex flows is based largely on grossly simplified models which capture in outline just a few pertinent microscopic features, such as coupling between stresses and other order parameters such as concentration. The role of 'structural memory' ( the dependence of structural parameters such as the micellar length distribution on the flow history) in explaining these highly nonlinear phenomena is addressed. Structural memory also plays an intriguing role in the little-understood shear thickening regime, which occurs in a concentration regime close to but below the onset of strong entanglement, and which is marked by a shear-induced transformation from an inviscid to a gelatinous state.},

@article{Szleifer1985,
abstract = {Starting from the partition function of a micellar aggregate, the various assumptions involved in decomposing the aggregate's standard chemical potential into surface and core terms are explicitly stated and discussed. The conformational statistics of the amphiphiles' hydrocarbon chains (tails) composing the hydrophobic core is assumed to be governed by the hard core repulsive interactions between chain segments. The density within the core is assumed uniform and liquid‐like. By appropriate expansion of the aggregate's configurational integral, explicit expressions are derived for the (singlet) distribution function of chain conformations and the chain's conformational partition function (free energy). These quantities depend on the thickness and curvature (geometry) of the hydrophobic core via the lateral pressures representing the geometric packing constraints. (The same distribution function has been previously derived by us using the maximal entropy formalism.) It is argued that the variations in the conformational contribution to the aggregate's chemical potential may be comparable to those due to the surface term. (In the prevailing models of amphiphile aggregation only the latter are included.) Detailed numerical analyses for model chains packed in spherical, cylindrical, and planar aggregates are presented in the subsequent paper (part II). One of the major conclusions from the calculations is that geometric packing constraints rather than internal energy (g a u c h e–t r a n s) effects are the dominant factors determining chain statistics.},

@article{Scarlata1990a,
abstract = {We have investigated the responsiveness of micelle and bilayer surfaces to changes in bulk pH through titrations, and to changes in lipid packing through the application of high hydrostatic pressure using two fluorescent, pH-sensitive surface probes. In micelles, the surface is very sensitive to bulk pH while in phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidic acid bilayers the surface charge changed little through a large pH region. Application of pressure on micelles causes proton dissociation due to the volume reduction achieved from the contraction of water around the charges (electrostriction). However, in bilayers, the effect of electrostriction is greatly reduced, most likely due to the energy needed to expand and hydrate the surface. The sign and amount of change in dissociation the probe undergoes with pressure depend on the initial degree of probe dissociation, which is in turn dependent on the particular surface rather than the charge of the lipid head groups comprising the bilayer. This finding may limit the use of fluorescent probes to determine the exact surface potential. By assuming the change in delta V for proton dissociation from the probe is constant for a given pH, we can calculate the changes in local pH that occur under pressure relative to a neutral or uncharged system. In doing so, we find that the local pH around the probe in bilayers changes very little (approximately 0.1 pH unit or less) in the first 2000 bars. Also, if pressure data are coupled with titration curves, we can determine the change that the bulk pH must undergo to produce the observed change in dissociation seen under pressure.},

The motion of the probe particles was tracked with diffusing wave spectroscopy, and the mean square displacement as a function of time for the particles was obtained. This allowed us to obtain the long-time diffusion coefficient for microspheres moving in the micellar network and the cage size where each particle is harmonically bound at short times in that network. The bulk mechanical susceptibility of the fluid determines the response of the probe particles excited by the thermal stochastic forces. As a consequence, the mean square displacement curves allowed us to calculate the elastic (storage) and the viscous (loss) moduli as a function of the frequency.

Micelle-embedded naphthols also act as novel self-fluorescence probes for monitoring viscoelasticity of the system as a function of applied shear. 1H NMR study shows that the solubilization sites of naphthols in the micelle are located near the surface. While UV absorption and Fourier transform infrared studies confirm the presence of intermolecular H-bonds in micelle embedded naphthols, transmission electron micrographs of vacuum-dried samples at room temperature demonstrate the transition in shape from sphere to rodlike micelles.},

The spectra of the glycerol/water mixtures can be well represented by a Davidson-Cole [J. Chem. Phys. 18, 1417 (1950)] relaxation function that reveals an unsymmetric relaxation time distribution. The effective dipole orientation correlation factor derived from the static permittivity displays an unspectacular behavior upon mixture composition. The dielectric relaxation time reveals a simple relation to the shear viscosity of the mixtures, but both quantities are not proportional to one another. The relaxation times at high temperatures nicely complement previously determined low temperature data, following a Vogel-Fulcher-Tammann-Hesse [Z. Phys. 22, 645 (1925); J. Am. Chem. Ceram. Soc. 8, 339 (1923); Z. Anorg. Allg. Chem. 156, 245 (1926)] (VFTH) temperature dependence. When the Eyring behavior is assumed a limiting high temperature form of the VFTH relation, enthalpy, and entropy of activation values are found which adopt significantly higher values in the glycerol rich mixtures than in the water rich liquids. The relaxation time distribution parameter at high water content indicates a dynamically heterogeneous structure of the liquids. Likely there exist glycerol rich and water rich microphases.},

Comparison of DLS data in D(2)O and H(2)O shows that the micelles are larger in the former case. The effect of salt on the micelle size was found to follow the Hofmeister series. Thus, at constant salt concentration, the micelle size decreases according to the sequence SO(4)(2)(-) {\textgreater} Cl(-) {\textgreater} NO(3)(-) {\textgreater} I(-) {\textgreater} SCN(-), where I(-) and SCN(-) act as salting-in anions. From tensiometric data, it can be concluded that the temperature effects on micelle morphology do not correlate directly with those on unimer solubility. Rather, the temperature effect on the hydrocarbon chain conformation seems to be decisive for the micelle morphology. At constant temperature, on the other hand, the effect of salt and deuterium isotope is attributable to changes in effective headgroup area, including intermolecular interactions and water of hydration.},

abstract = {In this article, we provide direct evidence for 1-D micellar growth and the formation of a network structure in an aqueous system of poly(oxyethylene) cholesteryl ether (ChEO(20)) and lauryl diethanolamide (L-02) by rheometry, small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), and cryo-transmission electron microscopy (cryo-TEM). The ChEO(20) self-assembles into spheroid micelles above the critical micelle concentration and undergoes a 1-D microstructural transition upon the incorporation of L-02, which because of its lipophilic nature tends to be solubilized into the micellar palisade layer and reduces the micellar curvature. The elongated micelles entangle with each other, forming network structures of wormlike micelles, and the system shows viscoelastic properties, which could be described by the Maxwell model. A peak observed in the zero-shear viscosity ($\eta$(0)) versus L-02 concentration curve shifted toward higher L-02 concentrations and the value of maximum viscosity ($\eta$(0 max)) increased with the increasing ChEO(20) mixing fraction with water. We observed that $\eta$(0 max) increased by 2 to 4 orders of magnitude as a function of the ChEO(20) concentration. The Maxwell relaxation time ($\tau$(R)) shows a maximum value at a concentration corresponding to $\eta$(0 max) (i.e., $\tau$(R) increases with L-02 concentration and then decreases after attaining a maximum value, whereas the plateau modulus (G(0)) shows monotonous growth). These observations demonstrate microstructural transitions in two different modes: L-02 first induces 1-D micellar growth and as a result the viscosity increases, and finally after the system attains its maximum viscosity, L-02 causes branching in the network structures. The microstructure transitions are confirmed by SAXS and cryo-TEM techniques.},

abstract = {The kinetics and mechanism of sphere-to-rod transitions of sodium alkyl sulfate micelles induced by hydrotropic salt, p-toluidine hydrochloride (PTHC), were investigated by stopped-flow with light scattering detection. Spherical sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) micelles transform into short ellipsoidal shapes at low salt concentrations ([PTHC]/[SDS], $\chi$PTHC= 0.3 and 0.4). Upon stopped-flow mixing aqueous solutions of spherical SDS micelles with PTHC, the scattered light intensity gradually increases with time. Single exponential fitting of the dynamic traces leads to characteristic relaxation time, $\tau$g, for the growth process from spherical to ellipsoidal micelles, and it increases with increasing SDS concentrations. This suggests that ellipsoidal micelles might be produced by successive insertion of unimers into spherical micelles, similar to the case of formation of spherical micelles as suggested by Aniansson-Wall (A-W) theory. At $\chi$PTHC≥ 0.5, rod-like micelles with much higher axial ratio form. The scattered light intensity exhibits an initially abrupt increase and then levels off. The dynamic curves can be well fitted with single exponential functions, and the obtained $\tau$gdecreases with increasing SDS concentration. Thus, the growth from spherical to rod-like micelles might proceed via fusion of spherical micelles, in agreement with mechanism proposed by Ikeda et al. At $\chi$PTHC= 0.3 and 0.6, the apparent activation energies obtained from temperature dependent kinetic studies for the micellar growth are 40.4 and 3.6 kJ/mol, respectively. The large differences between activation energies for the growth from spherical to ellipsoidal micelles at low $\chi$PTHCand the sphere-to-rod transition at high $\chi$PTHCfurther indicate that they should follow different mechanisms. Moreover, the sphere-to-rod transition kinetics of sodium alkyl sulfate with varying hydrophobic chain lengths (n = 10, 12, 14, and 16) are also studied. The longer the carbon chain lengths, the slower the sphere-to-rod transition. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {A molecular level description of the effect of urea on the stability of proteins or supramolecular aggregates such as micelles requires information about its interfacial concentration. Estimating interfacial urea concentrations has proved refractory because urea's association with interfaces is difficult to observe spectrometrically. Here we used a chemical trapping method based on product yields from spontaneous dediazoniation of micelle-bound 2,6-dimethyl-4-hexadecylbenzenediazonium ion to estimate the interfacial concentration of urea in micelles of cationic cetyltrimethylammonium halide (CTAX, X = Cl, Br), anionic sodium dodecyl sulfate, SDS, and sodium dodecyl sulfonate, SDSu, and zwitterionic N-hexadecyl-N,N-dimethylammonium propanesulfonate, HPS, surfactants. Up to 6-8 M added urea, the interfacial urea concentration is about 70{\%} (HPS), 80{\%} (CTABr), and 90{\%}0 (CTACl, SDS, and SDSu) of its stoichiometric concentration in solution, that is, not much less than its concentration in bulk solution. These results are the first direct estimate of interfacial urea concentrations. We also obtained estimates of interfacial water and counterion concentrations in CTAX micelles and interfacial water and headgroup concentrations in SDSu micelles. Taken together, the results provide substantial evidence that urea destabilization of interfacial headgroup . counterion ion pairs is a major contributor to urea's effects on micellar properties such as increasing the critical micelle concentration and the degree of ionization and decreasing aggregation number.},

abstract = {A number of dyes or fluorescent compounds show an appreciable change of extinction coefficient or quantum yield depending on whether they are in a surfactant solution at concentration above or under the critical micelle concentration (cmc). This effect was often used to determine cmc values, but it also provides a way of following, by spectrophotometric methods, the chemical relaxation of micellar equilibria upon a fast temperature jump. In this work we have investigated for different types of detergents (anionic, cationic, and nonionic) the effect of addition of dye on the relaxation kinetics of micellar solutions. We have found that: (1) when the ratio r = (detergent)/(dye) is above 150-200, the relaxation time characterizing the micellar solution is the same with and without added dye for the different dye-detergent systems; (2) the same remains true at values of r as low as 20 for the nonionic detergent investigated; and (3) dyes with an electrical charge opposite to that of the micelles are the most suitable for studying the kinetics of micellar equilibria. Acridine orange has been used for such a study of sodium dodecylsulfate that does not contain a chromophoric group, by means of T-jump with spectrophotometric detection. The results indicate a new type of variation of the relaxation time with the detergent concentration. {\textcopyright} 1975.},

This system is interesting because this complex salt forms wormlike micelles (WLM), in which the aromatic ring of salicylate threads into the micelle palisade. The chains of WLM of CTASal have excess of positive charge and, in the semi-dilute regime, form systems with very long relaxation time. However, the relaxation time become short when salt is added. The effect of NaCl, NaBr, NaNO3, NaSCN and NaSalicylate, on CTASal solutions was investigated by using rheology and SAXS. The systems in the presence of salts present shorter relaxation times due to the charge neutralization associated with the adsorption of the anions on the micelles surface. The magnitude of the effect depends on the nature of the anions, which follows the Hofmeister series.},

abstract = {We have investigated catanionic mixtures of the anionic surfactant sodium oleate with various alkyltrimethyl ammonium bromides of different alkyl chain length between octyl and tetradecyl. Around equimolar mixing vesicles are formed but only for a chain length of decyl and longer. For shorter chains and with increasing asymmetry of the mixing ratio, the vesicle phase disappears and instead wormlike micelles are formed, which leads to a viscoelastic behaviour of the samples. The vesicle systems are often also viscoelastic, if they contain densely packed multi-lamellar vesicles but this depends also on their salt content, as for instance the salt-free decyl system forms unilamellar vesicles of low viscosity. It is observed that the most well-defined vesicles (unilamellar) occur upon admixing the intermediate cationic surfactant with the dodecyl chain, which then results in low viscous solutions. In general, by appropriately choosing the mixing ratio, the length of the alkyl chain and also the ionic strength of the solution can tune the structure and the properties of these catanionic surfactant mixtures over a wide range in a systematic fashion.},

The appropriate description to use in a given situation depends on such factors as the spatial, temporal, and spectral properties of the stimulus.

It is suggested that amphiphilic self-assembly is a physical process that occurs in FA, in NMF and in DMF and the driving force for micelle formation correlates with solvophobicity. The surfactant-solvent interactions that drive amphiphilic self-organization in FA, in NMF and in DMF are discussed. These results are also explained by the structure of FA, NMF and of DMF.

@article{Haleem2004,
abstract = {The Qur an is the supreme authority in Islam. It is the fundamental and paramount source of the creed, rituals, ethics, and laws of the Islamic religion. This supreme status stems from the belief that the Qur an is the word of God, revealed to the Prophet Muhammad via the archangel Gabriel, and intended for all times and all places. The Qur an was the starting point for all the Islamic sciences, which were developed in order to study its grammar, pronunciation, and style, and it is the basis of Islamic law and theology; indeed, as the celebrated fifteenth-century scholar and author Suyuti said, 'Everything is based on the Qur an'. The entire religious life of the Muslim world is built around the text of the Qur an. As a consequence of the Qur an, the Arabic language moved far beyond the Arabian peninsula, deeply penetrating many other languages within the Muslim lands––Persian, Turkish, Urdu, Indonesian, and others. The first sura (or section) of the Qur an, al-Fatiha, which is an essential part of the ritual prayers, is learned and read in Arabic by Muslims in all parts of the world, and many other verses and phrases in Arabic are also incorporated into the lives of non-Arabic-speaking Muslims. M. A. S. Abdel Haleem was born in Egypt, and learned the Qur an by heart from childhood. Educated at al-Azhar, Cairo, and Cambridge Universities, he has taught Arabic at Cambridge and London Universities since 1966, including courses in advanced practical translation and the Qur an.},

abstract = {A systematic study that altered the number of $\beta$-hydrogen atoms susceptible to Hofmann elimination and introduced increased steric hindrance of substituted (ethyl, n-propyl, isobutyl, and neopentyl) alkyltrimethylammonium cations was performed. The mechanism of the thermal decomposition of these four ammonium cations in deuteroxide form was studied using evolved gas analysis (EGA) because of their potential importance in alkaline membrane fuel cells or electrolyzers. The products of the decomposition reactions are in many cases the expected Hofmann elimination products (trimethylamine and olefins), however, as the number of $\beta$-hydrogen atoms decrease or they become more sterically encumbered (from the addition of adjacent methyl groups), nucleophilic attack of hydroxide on the methyl groups increases in relative importance. The use of deuterated water and deuteroxide in our study shows that deprotonation of the tetraalkylammonium ions establishes a rapid equilibrium between the nitrogen ylide species that is formed by methyl group deprotonation and water that scrambles deuterium into the methyl groups of the amine. The results of this work show that at high temperature and low water content tetraalkylammonium hydroxide salts are relatively unstable in membranes. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Antimicrobial peptides hold potential as a possible alternative, or complement, to conventional antibiotics but new, safe and efficient means are needed for formulation and administration of the peptides. In this study we have investigated the utility of a novel type of lipid particles, the polyethylene glycol-stabilized lipid disks, as carriers for the model peptide melittin. The structural integrity of the carrier particle when loaded with the peptide was investigated using cryo-transmission electron microscopy. Liposome leakage upon addition of the peptide-lipid disks was monitored as a means to verify the membrane lytic effect of the formulation. The susceptibility of melittin to tryptic digestion was studied and compared in the absence and presence of lipid disks. Finally, the antibacterial effect of the peptide-lipid disk formulation was compared to that of free melittin after both single and repeated exposure to Escherichia coli. The results show that melittin can redistribute from the disk into a new host membrane and that formulation in the disks does not compromise melittin's membrane permeabilizing ability. Further, the peptide was found to be fully protected against degradation when bound to the disks. Time-kill experiments revealed that all the antibacterial effect of melittin administered in free form was gone after a single exposure to E. coli. In contrast, the disk formulation showed significant cell-killing effect also upon a second exposure to bacteria, indicating an extended release of peptide from the lipid disks. These results suggest that the lipid disks constitute a new class of promising carriers for peptide antibiotics. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The phase behavior of 2-hydroxy-1-naphthoic acid (2,1-HNC) mixed with cetyltrimethylammonium hydroxide (CTAOH) is reported. This novel system is compared with the published one of 3-hydroxy-2-naphthoic acid (3,2-HNC) mixed with CTAOH. We investigated the phase behavior and properties of the phases in aqueous solutions of 100 mM CTAOH with 2,1-HNC. In both systems a multilamellar vesicle phase is formed when the naphthoate/surfactant ratio (r) reaches unity. When an increasing amount of 2,1-HNC is mixed with a micellar solution of 100 mM CTAOH, an isotropic low-viscous micellar solution, a viscoelastic gel (consisting of rodlike micelles), a turbid region (two-phase region), and a viscoelastic liquid crystalline gel (consisting of multilamellar vesicles, MLV) were formed. The vesicular phase is highly viscoelastic and has a yield stress value. The transition from the micellar to the vesicle phase occurs for CTAOH/2,1-HNC over a two-phase region, where micelles and vesicles coexist. Also it was noticed that 2,1-HNC is dissolved in 100 mM CTAOH until the naphthoate/surfactant ratio reaches ∼1.5, and the liquid crystalline phases were found to change their color systematically when they were viewed between two crossed polarizers. The vesicles have been characterized by differential interference contrast microscopy, freeze-fracture electron microscopy, and cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-TEM). The vesicles were polydisperse and their diameter ranged from 100 to 1000 nm. The interlamellar spacing between the bilayers was determined with small angle neutron scattering and agrees with the results from different microscopical methods. The complex viscosity rises by six orders of magnitude when rodlike micelles are formed. The complex viscosity decreases again in the turbid region, and then rises approximately six orders of magnitude above the water viscosity. This second rising is due to the formation of the liquid crystalline MLV phase. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Based on this property, we present a thermal-flow study of a mixed giant micelle formed by the combination of two surfactants and sodium salicylate. One of the surfactants, cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (C16TAB) was kept fixed, and the others were dodecyltrimethylammonium bromide (C12TAB), tetradecyltrimethylammonium bromide (C14TAB), octadecyltrimethylammonium bromide (C18TAB), polyoxyethylene (10) oleyl ether (Brij 97) or sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS).

abstract = {We report on the rheology and deuteron nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements performed on the nematic lyotropic system sodium dodecyl sulfate, decanol, and water. For total surfactant and cosurfactant concentrations of about 30{\%} by weight, we prepared nematic calamitic N-C and nematic discotic N-D solutions. We have studied the flow behavior of the N-C and N-D phases in terms of the transient shear stress using different rheological histories. In flow-reversal experiments, the transient response exhibits nonperiodic oscillations in the region of small deformations (gamma = 20), which is followed by a long-lasting relaxation toward the stationary state. In the pseudo-Newtonian regime of the viscosity; we have found that the stress, when normalized to its long term value and plotted versus deformation, is shear-rate independent. H-2 NMR measurements at rest and under shear were performed on nematic calamitic and discotic solutions prepared in D2O. At rest, the NMR spectra exhibit well-resolved doublet structures, which indicate an alignment of the director along the axis of the magnetic field. At shear rates large enough ((gamma) over dot {\textgreater} 0.3 s(-1)) alignment is achieved with respect to the flow velocity. One finds alignment angles of 12 degrees and 105 degrees for the directors of the calamitic and discotic phase, respectively. Combining the results obtained by rheology and by NMR, we provide strong evidence that the N-C and N-D nematics of the sodium dodecyl sulfate / decanol system are textured nematics of the flow-aligning type.

abstract = {Sucrose monofatty acid esters form spherical or short‐rod micelles in water. By combining the sugar surfactant with lipophilic monoglyceride or short‐EO‐chain, poly (oxyethylene) alkyl ether (CmEOn) one‐dimensional growth of micelles takes place, and the viscosity of the aqueous mixed nonionic surfactant solution dramatically increases due to the entanglement of elongated wormlike micelles. Upon addition of oil (decane or m‐xylene), the viscosity changes in the opposite way. With a slightly polar m‐xylene, the viscosity increases, but the viscosity is sharply decreased upon addition of the saturated hydrocarbon decane. It was confirmed by SAXS results that long wormlike micelles are more extended by m‐xylene because the m‐xylene molecules are solubilized in the surfactant palisade layer, whereas decane is solubilized in the core of micelles and makes an oil pool inside. Consequently, upon addition of decane, wormlike micelles become shortened and change to short fat micelles. The oil‐induced structural change in the micellar shape is highly related to the solubilized site of oil in the aggregates.},

abstract = {The local viscosity of Pluronic F127 triblock copolymer micelles in water was determined with cyanine dyes as fluorescent probes. These dyes show very weak fluorescence at a low temperature, but show enhanced fluorescence at a temperature higher than the critical micellization temperature (T(cm)). This is because a viscous environment within the micelle suppresses the formation of a nonradiative twisted intramolecular charge transfer (TICT) excited state of the dyes. The good correlation between the fluorescence quantum yields of the dyes and the viscosity and the temperature of the media allows a determination of local viscosity of micelle based on the fluorescence quantum yields. The local viscosity of both core and corona regions of micelles increases at {\textgreater}T(cm) and shows a maximum at a temperature 7-9 °C higher than T(cm), and decreases at higher temperature due to the increased fluidity. The core viscosity is larger than that of the corona, and the corona viscosity increases toward the micelle center. The polymer concentration has different effects on the core and corona viscosity: the corona viscosity increases with a polymer concentration increase at the entire temperature range, whereas the core viscosity increases only at a low temperature. The corona viscosity increase is due to the condensation of a large number of polyethylene oxide (PEO) blocks. In contrast, the dehydration degree of polypropylene oxide (PPO) blocks in the core scarcely changes, and the core has a similar composition regardless of polymer concentration. The larger polymer concentration promotes a micelle formation at lower temperature where the fluidity increase is very weak, resulting in larger core viscosity.},

The method is applied to evaluate tracer experiments carried out in a laboratory model tank. The CCD photos deliver RGB values which are transferred into concentrations for the evaluation of vertical concentration profiles over the whole tank area. A specially developed evaluation procedure, including internal referencing for noise reduction, considers the colour of the adjacencies of the evaluated spots and scattering effects. The CCD data evaluation technique is accompanied by conventional sampling and absorption measurements and by numerical flow and transport simulations. This non-invasive technique allows a direct mapping of the concentration distribution without any disturbance of the solute plume. Therefore, it turns out to be an important tool for a detailed investigation of fundamental processes (e.g. transverse dispersion) determining the solute (e.g. contaminant) transport in porous media.},

abstract = {The effect of an external electric field on ternary mixtures consisting of lecithin, n-decane, and small amounts of polar additives (water or glycerol) has been studied by oscillating theology, polarizing microscopy, and electric birefringence. It is shown that an electric field that is applied induces a so-called electrotheological (ER) effect, i.e., an increase in the viscosity and dynamic shear moduli of all the examined mixtures. The ER effect is absent in solutions of nonoverlapping micelles. The electric field causes the formation of fiber-like structures in the interelectrode gap. The ER effect becomes evident at a critical field of about 40 and 100 V/mm for water- and glycerol-containing organogels, respectively. In the latter case, a region of the reproducible and stable ER effect is extended up to 1700 V/mm, which is 3-4 times greater than that observed in the jelly-like phases with water. The buildup, as followed from birefringent measurements, includes fast and slow processes. Those correspond to both the local motions of parts of micellar chains and the restructuring of the whole network under the action of an external electric field. The ER response depends on the molar ratio of the polar additives to lecithin. Diagrams describing the behavior of ternary mixtures under the electric field have been constructed. They differ for water- and glycerol-containing organogels. The dependence of the stable ER effects on the molar ratio of glycerol to lecithin has a maximum in the vicinity of the phase separation of the homogeneous organogel, whereas for water-containing systems there is a gradual increase up to and including mixtures with the solid precipitate. A new theological regime has been first established for solutions of polymer-like micelles. This feature is the square-root scaling of the dynamic moduli with the frequency. Such a scaling is inherent in polymers. A possible mechanism is considered, basing on the ordering of cylindrical micelles under the action of an external electric field.},

abstract = {Wrought iron was the first form of iron used by man to produce weapons and tools, with the exception of tiny supplies of meteoric material. It had the very important property that it could be hammered to shape; indeed, the word “wrought” means “that which has been shaped by forging, rolling or drawing”. One of the earliest references is in the Bible, Genesis 4:22, where Tubal Cain was described as “the one who forged all kinds of tools out of bronze and iron”. Wrought iron has been defined by the American Society for Testing Materials (ASTM) as “a ferrous material, aggregated from a solidifying mass of pasty particles of highly refined metallic iron with which, without subsequent fusion is incorporated a minutely and uniformly distributed quantity of slag”. In many old artifacts the slag and iron are irregularly dispersed and form an intimate mechanical mixture. The smelting of ore with charcoal must have been dis- covered independently in many parts of the world and there is evidence from the third millennium B.C.E. of production in Egypt and Anatola, Turkey. Wrought iron was all forged by hand until waterpower was harnessed in the 13th century C.E. According to Dennis (1), wrought iron was the most important ferrous engineering material up to the middle of the 19th century, when the production in the United King- dom alone was 2.5 × 106 tons per year. After 1856 its im- portance decreased owing to the increased production of Bessemer steel. Wrought iron is still produced in small quantities, however, for blacksmiths to make articles such as horseshoes, railings, and decorative ironware.},

No differences in $\Delta$H for micelle dilution and demicellization was observed at 22 °C. The temperature dependence of $\Delta$H measured by ITC could be related to hydrophobic interactions. Therefore, ITC was shown to be a useful tool to describe the thermodynamics of demicellization processes and in addition to determine alterations in $\Delta$H caused by changes in hydrophobic and steric∕electrostatic interactions.},

Beyond c*, we observed rapid, nonequilibrium aggregation of the particles to form "transient gels". These space-filling structures can show rapid gravitational collapse after an initial "latency period", a behavior also found in model colloid-polymer mixtures at high polymer concentrations. The depletion mechanism was found to play an important role in phase separation. Diffusing wave spectroscopy (DWS) was used to study the dynamics of a transient gel. After about one-half of the latency period, the fluctuations in the scattered intensity increased significantly. The particle dynamics slowed during the whole latency period, consistent with the aging of the gel structure. After gravitational collapse, a very broad, logarithmic decay of the correlation function was detected for the sediment.},

The simplistic assumption of a single and constant relaxation time is not representative of all relaxation modes in these solutions especially at high frequencies. Experiments: Steady-state and oscillatory measurements are carried out to study the effects of high temperature, concentration and resting condition on the rheology of surfactants/salt mixtures including a non-ionic and a zwitterionic/anionic surfactant system. Furthermore, a novel semi-empirical rheological model is deducted based on Cates theory. This model introduces, for the first time, a frequency-dependence for the continuous relaxation time spectrum. Findings: At high temperatures, the non-ionic surfactant become more viscoelastic and the zwitterionic/anionic system loses its viscoelasticity. The addition of surfactant/salt improves the viscoelasticity of both systems, and, for the zwitterionic/anionic mixture, increasing the resting temperature improves its viscoelasticity. In addition, the proposed model significantly improves predictions of traditional Maxwell model for different viscoelastic surfactant solutions (using data from this study and the literature) for a considerable range of surfactant and salt combinations at a wide range of temperature.},

abstract = {A series of experiments were performed to further investigate the phenomenon of shear-banding in surfactant solutions. Many surfactant solutions, through their unique amphiphilic chemistry, form long wormlike micelle structures which behave like living polymers. These wormlike micelles have interesting viscoelastic properties and have been the subject of a number of recent studies. These water-based surfactant systems are widely used in many commercial and industrial applications; however, many aspects of their complex flow behavior are still not fully understood. In this study, a Couette cell was designed to allow for high-resolution optical access in a simple shear flow of a surfactant system comprised of cetylpyridinium chloride and sodium salicylate in aqueous sodium chloride. Beyond a critical stress, this system is found to enter a non-linear regime in which there is a plateau in the shear stress with increasing shear rate. Within this plateau, the fluid forms distinct bands of varying shear rate. The goal of this study was to obtain high spatial and temporal resolution particle-image velocimetry and flow-induced birefringence results in both steady and transient-startup flows. As a consequence of the high resolution, steady PIV results suggest the existence of multiple-shear bands. In the transient PIV experiments, we observe a propagating damped elastic wave, as well as fluctuations in the shear-band evolution on timescales of less than one relaxation time. Pointwise FIB gap profiles show a diffuse birefringent region prior to the onset of shear-banding in the velocity profiles. These results provide insight on the flow behavior, as well as a full set of experimental data which will drive development of constitutive models capable of predicting shear-banding. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

In the temperature and range studied, the aqueous solutions made with CTA2FB do not exhibit shear thickening because 2FB is more kosmotropic than the 3FB and 4FB counterions, and larger shear rates than the ones covered here are needed to observed shear thickening in the CTA2FB system. CTA3FB and CTA4FB aqueous solutions undergo the shear thickening transition due to the formation of shear induced structures (SIS) in the shear range studied. The shear thickening transition in CTA3FB micellar solutions is stronger and appears at lower shear rates than that detected in CTA4FB ones; in addition, the intensity of shear thickening in both systems augments as the parallel-plates gap is increased. These discrepancies detected between the three surfactants studied are related to the differences among the counterion hydrophobicity i.e., 3FB-{\textgreater}4FB-{\textgreater}2FB-.

abstract = {Self-driven flow was observed in Nafion and other hydrophilic tubes immersed in water. The intratubular flow was generated when water came in contact with the tube's hydrophilic surfaces. Flow characteristics were studied in tubes of varying size, exposed to light of different intensities and wavelengths. The results lead to the hypothesis that the flow is driven by a high concentration of protons accumulating inside the tube, creating an axial proton gradient between the inside and outside of the tube. We also demonstrate a faster flow under incident light, particularly at UV wavelengths, implying that proton generation may be driven by light.},

abstract = {The Krafft temperature, TK, of two classical ionic surfactants, sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB), were measured by conductivity, in the absence and in the presence of added salt, to test a recent suggestion (J. Phys. Chem. B 2002, 106, 9033) that TK measurements can be used to estimate the degree of counterion dissociation of ionic micelles, R. The method is based on the fact that TK of SDS and CTAB are functions of the concentration of counterions in the aqueous phase, Caq, whether the counterions are provided by the surfactant or both the surfactant and added salt. The values of R are estimated by requiring that the values of TK fall on a common curve when plotted against any function of Caq and are found to be in good agreement with the literature. The present results confirm that the Krafft temperature of ionic surfactants is one of the properties from which R can be derived for both anionic and cationic micelles. In the case of SDS, because the aggregation number, N, is known as a function of Caq, TK may be plotted versus N. The plot showed excellent linear correlation; however, it is not yet known if the linear behavior is theoretically significant.},

The use of the combined methods allowed the discovery of gradient shear banding flow occurring from a critical shear stress and consisting of two main bands, one isotropic (transparent) of high viscosity and one structured (turbid) of low viscosity. Mechanical rheometry indicated macroscopic shear thinning behavior in the shear banding regime. However, local velocimetry showed that the turbid band increased its viscosity along with the shear stress, even though barely reached the value of the viscosity of the isotropic phase. This shear band is the precursor of shear induced structures that subsequently give rise to the average increase in viscosity or apparent shear thickening of the solution.

@article{Vogtt2017,
abstract = {Wormlike micelles (WLMs) are nanoscale, self-assembled components of many products from shampoos to fracking fluids due to their viscoelasticity. Their rheological behavior is largely governed by the contour length of the micelles and the concomitant propensity of the micelles to overlap and entangle. The large contour lengths, on the order of micrometers, is the result of a delicate balance between the scission enthalpy of the wormlike micelles on the one hand and entropic factors such as the mixing entropy of dispersion, the ordering of water molecules and counterions, and the mobility of branch points on the other hand. The structure and contour length of wormlike micelles assembled from sodium laureth-1-sulfate was determined at various temperatures using small-angle neutron scattering. The results allow the calculation of the enthalpy and entropy as well as the free energy of scission and are employed to critically evaluate the common methods to determine micellar scission energy from mean-field theory. Interesting behavior is observed when comparing branched and unbranched WLMs that may reflect on mechanistic differences in chain scission.},

abstract = {Radiofrequency (RF) waves have long been used for different types of information exchange via the air waves-wireless Morse code, radio, television, and wireless telephone (i.e., construction and operation of telephones or telephone systems). Increasingly larger numbers of people rely on mobile telephone technology, and health concerns about the associated RF exposure have been raised, particularly because the mobile phone handset operates in close proximity to the human body, and also because large numbers of base station antennas are required to provide widespread availability of service to large populations. The World Health Organization convened an expert workshop to discuss the current state of cellular-telephone health issues, and this article brings together several of the key points that were addressed. The possibility of RF health effects has been investigated in epidemiology studies of cellular telephone users and workers in RF occupations, in experiments with animals exposed to cell-phone RF, and via biophysical consideration of cell-phone RF electric-field intensity and the effect of RF modulation schemes. As summarized here, these separate avenues of scientific investigation provide little support for adverse health effects arising from RF exposure at levels below current international standards. Moreover, radio and television broadcast waves have exposed populations to RF for {\textgreater} 50 years with little evidence of deleterious health consequences. Despite unavoidable uncertainty, current scientific data are consistent with the conclusion that public exposures to permissible RF levels from mobile telephone and base stations are not likely to adversely affect human health.},

In this framework, a research finding is less likely to be true when the studies conducted in a field are smaller; when effect sizes are smaller; when there is a greater number and lesser preselection of tested relationships; where there is greater flexibility in designs, definitions, outcomes, and analytical modes; when there is greater financial and other interest and prejudice; and when more teams are involved in a scientific field in chase of statistical significance. Simulations show that for most study designs and settings, it is more likely for a research claim to be false than true. Moreover, for many current scientific fields, claimed research findings may often be simply accurate measures of the prevailing bias.

Consequently these additives are likely to absorb to surfaces where their free energy is minimized. Experiments described in this work examine the two-dimensional phase behavior and vibrational structure of IN1076 and IN1010 films adsorbed to the air/water interface. Surface pressure isotherms show that repeated compression of these films leads to continued irreversible loss of molecules and that on a per molecule basis, this loss is more pronounced for IN1076 than for IN1010. Differences in the surface properties of these two antioxidant additives are interpreted based on differences in molecular structure. Surface specific vibrational measurements of these organic films show very little conformational order, implying that even when closely packed, both antioxidant species have little affinity for forming highly organized domains. These findings have important ramifications for mechanisms that reduce antioxidant activity in polymers as well as descriptions of antioxidant blooming on polymer surfaces. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Inc.

The two surfactants differ only for the nucleoside at the phospholipid polar headgroup and self-assemble in solution to form supramolecular structures that behave dissimilarly. The uridine derivative forms long wormlike aggregates that are invariant with the aging of the solution, while the wormlike aggregate of the adenosine derivative undergoes, as the sample ages, a subsequent self-assembling process forming giant helicoidal aggregates that coexist with the smaller wormlike aggregates. Dynamic light scattering and cryo-TEM show that the large helicoidal structures are formed at the expense of the small wormlike micelles. The 1:1 mixture behaves as the adenosine derivative and evolves to form giant superstructures for all the lipid concentrations investigated. Circular dichroism measurements suggest that the formation of the supramolecular helicoidal structure might not be driven by a purely chiral effect, but rather stacking and hydrogen bonding, present at the phospholipid headgroups of the self-assembled nucleosides, contribute to the final supramolecular structure. {\textcopyright} 2006 American Chemical Society.},

abstract = {The growth behavior of surfactant micelles has been investigated from a theoretical point of view. It is demonstrated that predictions deduced from the spherocylindrical micelle model, which considers micelles that are only able to grow in the length direction, are inconsistent with experimental measurements. Accordingly, the rise in aggregation numbers above a certain concentration, roughly corresponding to the second critical micelle concentration, appears to be much stronger than predicted by the spherocylindrical micelle model. On the other hand, predictions deduced from the general micelle model, which considers micelles that are able to grow with respect to both width and length, show excellent agreement with experimental observations. The latter theory is based on bending elasticity and it is demonstrated that the associated three parameters spontaneous curvature, bending rigidity and saddle-splay constant may all be determined for a micellar system from experimental measurements of the aggregation number as a function of surfactant concentration. The three parameters turn out to influence the appearance of a micellar growth curve rather differently. In accordance, the location of the second cmc is mainly determined by the saddle-splay constant and the bending rigidity. The shape of the growth curve, when going from the region of weakly growing micelles at low surfactant concentrations to strongly growing micelles above the second cmc, is mainly influenced by the bending rigidity.},

abstract = {Rheological properties of aqueous solutions of long-tailed cationic surfactant erucyl bis-(hydroxyethyl)methylammonium chloride (EHAC) were examined as a function of concentration C-s of different inorganic salts (KCl, CaCl2, and LaCl3) at a fixed surfactant concentration of 0.6 wt {\%}. The structural evolution of micelles was followed by small angle neutron scattering and cryogenic transmission electron microscopy. It was observed that, upon addition of salt, the zero-shear viscosity eta(0) of semidilute surfactant solutions goes through a maximum by passing the following three regimes: eta(0) similar to C-s(10) (regime I), eta(0) similar to C-s(3.5) (regime II), and eta(0) similar to C-s(-2) (regime III). In regime I, the micelles grow in length; in regime II, the linear growth of micelles proceeds simultaneously with their branching; and in regime III, the branching becomes dominating. With increase in the salt valence, the viscosity curves shift to a lower salt content, indicating that these salts are more effective in inducing micellar elongation and branching, as they contain a larger amount of anionic species Cl- screening the repulsion between cationic surfactant heads. Diverse roles of salt co- and counterions (i.e., salt ions that are similar and oppositely charged with respect to surfactant head groups) at different salt concentrations were demonstrated. It was shown that at low salt concentrations corresponding to the rising branch of the viscosity curve (regimes I and II), salt counterions (Cl-) fully determine the rheological behavior of the system. At high salt concentrations, when the electrostatic repulsions between micelles and salt co-ions are essentially screened, the co-ions start affecting the rheological properties. Under these conditions, monovalent co-ions (K+) provide much lower viscosity of surfactant solutions than the multivalent ones (Ca2+, La3+), which is consistent with theoretical predictions that suggest the penetration of K+ inside the micellar corona increasing the charge of the micelles and therefore hindering their growth.},

In this study our interest is focused on the relevance of the microscopic model by comparing the results of the simulations with the predictions of mesoscopic theories. The simulated behavior shows an exponential distribution for the micellar length and an exponential dependence of the average length on the scission energy at equilibrium. These results correspond to those calculated from Cates mesoscopic theory. Results of simulations concerning the effect of shear flow on the size distribution and on the average length of the micelles are also reported and discussed.},

abstract = {Background Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) is a general technique that allows for precise and highly sensitive measurements. These measurements may provide a complete and accurate thermodynamic description of association processes in complex systems such as colloidal mixtures. Scope of the review This review will address uses of ITC for studies of surfactant aggregation to form micelles, with emphasis on the thermodynamic studies of homologous surfactant series. We will also review studies on surfactant association with polymers of different molecular characteristics and with colloidal particles. General significance ITC studies on the association of different homologous series of surfactants provide quantitative information on independent contribution from their apolar hydrocarbon chains and polar headgroups to the different thermodynamic functions associated with micellization (Gibbs energy, enthalpy and entropy). Studies on surfactant association to polymers by ITC provide a comprehensive description of the association process, including examples in which particular features revealed by ITC were elucidated by using ancillary techniques such as light or X-ray scattering measurements. Examples of uses of ITC to follow surfactant association to biomolecules such as proteins or DNA, or nanoparticles are also highlighted. Finally, recent theoretical models that were proposed to analyze ITC data in terms of binding/association processes are discussed. Major conclusions This review stresses the importance of using direct calorimetric measurements to obtain and report accurate thermodynamic data, even in complex systems. These data, whenever possible, should be confirmed and associated with other ancillary techniques that allow elucidation of the nature of the transformations detected by calorimetric results, providing a complete description of the process under scrutiny.

abstract = {The surface dilational modulus—or compressibility modulus—has been previously studied for monolayers composed of pure materials, where a jump in this modulus was related with the onset of percolation as a result of the establishment of a connected structure at the molecular level. In this work, we focused on monolayers composed of two components of low lateral miscibility. Our aim was to investigate the compressibility of mixed monolayers at pressures and compositions in the two-phase region of the phase diagram, in order to analyze the effect of the mechanical properties of each phase on the stiffness of the composite. In nine different systems with distinct molecular dipoles and charges, the stiffness of each phase and the texture at the plane of the monolayer were studied. In this way, we were able to analyze the general compressibility of two-phase lipid monolayers, regardless of the properties of their constituent parts. The results are discussed in the light of the following two hypotheses: first, the stiffness of the composite could be dominated by the stiffness of each phase as a weighted sum according to the percentage of each phase area, regardless of the distribution of the phases in the plane of the monolayer. Alternatively, the stiffness of the composite could be dominated by the mechanical properties of the continuous phase. Our results were better explained by this latter proposal, as in all the analyzed mixtures it was found that the mechanical properties of the percolating phase were the determining factors. The value of the compression modulus was closer to the value of the connected phase than to that of the dispersed phase, indicating that the bidimensional composites displayed mechanical properties that were related to the properties of each phases in a rather complex manner.},

abstract = {Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) allows the determination of DeltaG degrees, DeltaH degrees, and DeltaS degrees from a single experiment and is thus widely used for studying binding thermodynamics in both biological and synthetic supramolecular systems. However, it is widely believed that it is not possible to derive accurate thermodynamic information from ITC experiments in which the Wiseman "c" parameter (which is the product of the receptor concentration and the binding constant, K(a)) is less than ca. 10, constraining its use to high affinity systems. Herein, experimental titrations and simulated data are used to demonstrate that this dogma is false, especially for low affinity systems, assuming that (1) a sufficient portion of the binding isotherm is used for analysis, (2) the binding stoichiometry is known, (3) the concentrations of both ligand and receptor are known with accuracy, and (4) there is an adequate level of signal-to-noise in the data. This study supports the validity of ITC for determining the value of K(a) and, hence, DeltaG degrees from experiments conducted under low c conditions but advocates greater caution in the interpretation of values for DeltaH degrees. Therefore, isothermal titration calorimetry is a valid and useful technique for studying biologically and synthetically important low affinity systems.},

Thermodynamic modeling of the reaction equilibria shows that, although mixtures of single- and double-tailed surfactants are formed, it is mainly the double-tailed surfactant that assembles into the wormlike micelles.},

The hydrophobic effect is a unique organizing force, based on repulsion by the solvent instead of attractive forces at the site of organization. It is responsible for assembly of membranes of cells and intracellular compartments, and the absence of strong attractive forces makes the membranes fluid and deformable. The spontaneous folding of proteins, however, involves directed polar bonds, leading to more rigid structures. Intercellular organization probably involves polar bonds between cell surface proteins.},

On the other hand, the magnitude of a fast relaxation mechanism with the relaxation time $\tau$f ? 0.5 ns was proportional to CD. The slow relaxation mode was attributed to the fluctuation of a counterion distribution around the spherical micelle or that of a distribution of dissociated cationic surfactant headgroups on the micellar surface.

abstract = {A new and simple equation, with only one parameter, was developed to model the equilibrium surface tension of the air/cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) solution interface. The new equilibrium model provides a single best-fitted prediction, instead of several solutions obtained by the conventional Szyszkowski equation. Subsequently, the equation was used to develop a new dynamic model, which does not require a Gibbs adsorption isotherm. The diffusion coefficient of CATB was also independently measured by1H NMR and used as an input for the new dynamic model. The new model was applied to dynamic surface tension data at 2 different concentrations simultaneously to obtain best-fitted values for adsorption parameters. The modeling result was consistent with all experimental results. In contrast to previous studies in the literature, the new model predicts dynamic surface tension of CTAB successfully by a diffusion-controlled mechanism and a kinetics step was not required. The study provides a new and effective dynamic model for dynamic surface tension at the air/water interface. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

From the specific conductance ($\kappa$), various parameters such as critical micelle concentration (CMC), degree of ionization of micelle ($\beta$), standard Gibbs free energy ($\Delta$Gom), enthalpy ($\Delta$Hom), and entropy ($\Delta$Som) of micellization have also been calculated. The CMC values of CTAB increase with rise of temperature and decrease linearly with increase in the concentration of PHC. The ITC measurements provide additional insights into the various thermodynamic parameters associated with the micellization process. The results from both techniques have been used to study the influence of PHC on the micellization behaviour of the surfactant.},

abstract = {The rheological properties of surfactant solutions play an important role in their applications. Here we study systematically how different cosurfactants affect the rheological properties of mixed solutions of the anionic surfactant sodium laurylether sulfate (SLES) and the zwitterionic cocoamidopropyl betaine (CAPB). Mixed SLES + CAPB solutions are used in various formulations due to their excellent foaming and cleaning properties. These solutions possess nearly Newtonian behavior and low viscosity. However, the addition of cosurfactants in low concentrations may significantly increase the viscosity of these solutions and even transform them into viscoelastic gels. Here we study systematically a wide range of ionic and nonionic cosurfactants with different head-groups, chain-lengths and structures of the hydrophobic tails (linear, branched, double bonded). We reveal an optimal chain-length of 8–10 carbon atoms of the cosurfactant molecules which ensures the highest viscoelasticity of the triple SLES + CAPB + cosurfactant solutions. Cationic cosurfactants and nonionic ones with small head-group (e.g. fatty alcohols and fatty acids) are most efficient in increasing the solution viscoelasticity. There is a hierarchy in the parameters of the cosurfactant molecules which govern this behavior − most important is the head-group charge, then the chain-length and, finally, the presence of branching and double bonds in the hydrophobic tails. The observed trends are explained with the effect of the cosurfactant molecules on the properties of the entangled wormlike micelles formed in these solutions.},

abstract = {This paper presents the synthesis of two polymeric surfactants, consisting of a polysiloxane backbone with amphiphilic side chains of the nonionic oligo(ethylene oxide) type, and their phase behavior in aqueous solution, investigated by polarizing microscopy and deuterium NMR spectroscopy using D2O as a probe. Two different side chains, which are isomeric glycerol derivatives, were synthesized and attached to poly(methyl hydrogen siloxane) by a hydrosilylation reaction, resulting in a tail-type and a mid-type polysurfactant. The side chains of the tail-type system are fixed at the end of the hydrophobic moiety, whereas the side-chains of the mid-type system are tethered to the polymer backbone by a short spacer close to the hydrophilic-hydrophobic junction of the amphiphile. Both polymers form a lamellar phase in aqueous solution over a wide range of concentrations, whereas the side chain precursors do not form lyomesophases. The cloud curve and the lamellar region are observed at lower temperatures in the mid-type polysurfactant.},

abstract = {The nature of transition from ordinary micelles (of nanometer length scale) of surface active ionic liquid 1-Hexadecyl-3- methylimidazolium chloride, to wormlike micelles (WLM) (micrometer length scale), mediated by hydroxy aromatic $\pi$-electron systems 1-Naphthol, 2-Naphthol and 2,3-Dihydroxynaphthalene (2,3-DHN) in salt free condition have been studied under Newtonian as well as non-Newtonian flow regimes. Conductance and tensiometry show that the additives lower the CMC of the ionic liquid. The interaction parameter ($\beta$) of the systems at different mole fraction evaluated on basis of Rubingh's Regular solution approach were negative at all SAIL/Additive compositions. UV–vis spectroscopy showed that micelle-bound additives formed hydrogen bonds with interfacial water molecules. Increase in steady state fluorescence anisotropic measurements revealed that the additives increasingly partitioned within the micelles. 1H NMR study confirmed that although the additives reside at the palisade layer, they perturb the micellar core as well. At higher concentration (100 mM, 1:1), systems formed transparent viscoelastic gel. Rheological study of the viscoelastic gels showed that their zero shear viscosity is a function of temperature. 2,3-DHN interacted most strongly with the SAIL micelles, both in Newtonian and non-Newtonian regimes. This was corroborated by DFT study of binding energy. Hydrogen bonding of the hydroxy functionality along with strong cation-$\pi$ interaction between the aromatic moieties and the imidazolium ring are considered as the main driving forces behind the morphology change. The viscosity of C16-3-MeImCl/1-Naphthol increased as function of salt concentration unlike C16-3-MeImCl/NaSal system. A possible mechanism is suggested and discussed. The present study sheds light on understanding the molecular interactions behind the structural change from spherical to elongated micelles, in both microscopic and macroscopic scale, triggered by hydroxy naphthalenes under salt-free condition. The metal tolerance of the gels has huge application prospects as fractured fluids in oil-mining industry.},

abstract = {Understanding the evolution of language requires evidence regarding origins and processes that led to change. In the last 40 years, there has been an explosion of research on this problem as well as a sense that considerable progress has been made. We argue instead that the richness of ideas is accompanied by a poverty of evidence, with essentially no explanation of how and why our linguistic computations and representations evolved. We show that, to date, 1) studies of nonhuman animals provide virtually no relevant parallels to human linguistic communication, and none to the underlying biological capacity; 2) the fossil and archaeological evidence does not inform our understanding of the computations and representations of our earliest ancestors, leaving details of origins and selective pressure unresolved; 3) our understanding of the genetics of language is so impoverished that there is little hope of connecting genes to linguistic processes any time soon; 4) all modeling attempts have made unfounded assumptions, and have provided no empirical tests, thus leaving any insights into language's origins unverifiable. Based on the current state of evidence, we submit that the most fundamental questions about the origins and evolution of our linguistic capacity remain as mysterious as ever, with considerable uncertainty about the discovery of either relevant or conclusive evidence that can adjudicate among the many open hypotheses. We conclude by presenting some suggestions about possible paths forward.},

abstract = {Recently, much attention has been focused on the utilization of plant biomass to produce engineering materials, encompassing the technological/scientific aspects as well as the economic, environmental and social issues. Amongst the variety of agricultural wastes or biomasses available, rice-husk (RH) occupies a preeminent position, not only in terms of its amount produced worldwide, but also because of its unique chemistry-related features. In this sense, some attempts have been made to produce advanced materials - including SiO2, SiC, Si3N4, elemental Si, Mg2Si and more recently, active carbon -, using RH. The production of those mentioned advanced materials depends largely on the treatments used (physical and/or chemical) and the reactions involved in the process, such as pyrolysis, carbothermal and reduction processes. In this contribution, a critical review on the processing and application of rice husks (RHs) for the production of various silicon-based materials and of active carbon is presented. The review addresses the different processing methods, the effects of various process parameters on the pyrolysis stage, the influence of physical, chemical and thermal treatments, activating conditions and activated carbon consolidation mechanisms. A flow chart with all the possible routes to produce SiO2was purposely constructed.},

abstract = {We report an investigation on the aggregation of 1,2-dilauroyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidyluridine (DLPU), a surfactant molecule that merges the self-assembling properties of lecithins with the molecular recognition characteristics of nucleic bases in a phosphate-buffered aqueous solution at physiological pH and as a function of lipid concentration. Because spontaneous self-assembly and interfacial properties are the result of a delicate balance between hydrophobic interactions and polar-head interactions, a structural characterization is essential for a complete and full understanding of base-base properties in the aggregates, as observed by spectroscopic techniques. Small-angle neutron scattering, static light scattering, and quasi-elastic light scattering have been employed to assess the structural evolution of the binary system as the lipid concentration is increased. The data indicate the presence of rather flexible elongated aggregates, whose local structure is cylindrical and remains essentially unchanged during micellar growth. Scattering data are fully supported by cryo-TEM analysis. The results are consistent with micellar unidimensional growth to giant wormlike aggregates that eventually entangle to form a transient network with a response to mechanical stress that is similar to that of polymer solutions in the semidilute range. Such aggregates are known as polymerlike micelles to stress the similarity with the behavior of macromolecules in good solvents. In our case, the correspondence is not limited to a mesosocopic structural scale because from a chemical point of view each monomer contains a nucleic acid functionality that is also expressed in the polymerlike aggregates whose biopolymeric counterpart is in fact a polynucleotide. Therefore, these new aggregates can be considered to be the first example of an "associative polynucleotide".},

abstract = {The addition of short-EO-chain polyoxyethylene dodecyl ether (C12EOn) surfactants to a dilute solution of polyoxyethylene cholesteryl ether (ChEO(m), m = 10 and 15) induced unidimensional micellar growth leading to the formation of viscoelastic solutions. The viscoelastic systems show Maxwellian behavior over a wide range of shear frequency and are considered to consist of a transient network of wormlike micelles. With increasing concentration Of C12EOn (n = 1-4) at fixed ChEO(10) concentration in a micellar solution phase, at first a gradual and then a steep increase in zero-shear viscosity (eta(o)) was observed. The mixing fraction of C12EOn to increase eta(o) or induce the micellar growth increases in the following order: C12EO1 approximate to C12EO2 {\textless} C12EO3 {\textless} C12EO4. On increasing m of ChEO(m) from 10 to 15 in the ChEO(m)-C12EO3 system, a sharp increase in eta(o) is shifted to relatively higher mixing fraction Of C12EO3. These results indicate that the average section area per surfactant in a micelle decreases upon the addition of short-EO-chain C12EOn and that micelles grow to form long rod micelles. Assuming that the cross-sectional area of each of the amphiphiles at the hydrophobic interface, a,, is constant (ideal surface mixing), the rod micellar length was calculated as a function of the mixing fraction Of C12EOn in the total amphiphile, X, using the data obtained from experimental results. The calculated results on micellar growth well explained the results of theological measurements. [References: 29]},

abstract = {We have measured a strong increase in the size and polydispersity of SDS micelles on increasing the detergent concentration in solutions containing high salt (NaCl) concentration. The mean hydrodynamic radius fih and the polydispersity of the micelles were measured over the following regions of temperature, detergent, and salt concentrations: 17 "C I T I 70 "C, 0.031 g/dL I [SDS] I 2 g/dL, 0.5 M I [NaCl] I 0.8 M, using the methods of quasielastic light scattering spectroscopy (QLS). In 0.8 M NaCl and at 20 "C, Rh increases from 60 to 218 A as detergent concentration ranges from 0.031 to 2 g/dL. A thermodynamic theory of micelle formation and growth is presented. This theory makes use of the experimentally established result that the micelles have the shape of prolate spherocylinders. The micellar size and polydispersity is determined at each temperature and salt concentration by two chemical potentials. These are the chemical potential changes associated with transferring a detergent monomer from the solvent to either the cylindrical or spherical region of the micelle. Using only these two chemical potentials as parameters, one can predict accurately the hydrodynamic radius Rh, the polydispersity, and the scattered light intensity over the entire experimental range of detergent con- centration, temperature, and salt concentration. The physical origins of the chemical potentials are then analyzed from their observed magnitudes and dependence on salt concentration and temperature.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: Worm-like and spherical micelles are both prepared here from the same amphiphilic diblock copolymer, poly(ethylene oxide)-b-poly (epsilon-caprolactone) (PEO [5 kDa]-PCL [6.5 kDa]) in order to compare loading and delivery of hydrophobic drugs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Worm-like micelles of this degradable copolymer are nanometers in cross-section and spontaneously assemble to stable lengths of microns, resembling filoviruses in some respects and thus suggesting the moniker 'filomicelles'. The highly flexible worm-like micelles can also be sonicated to generate kinetically stable spherical micelles composed of the same copolymer. RESULTS: The fission process exploits the finding that the PCL cores are fluid, rather than glassy or crystalline, and core-loading of the hydrophobic anticancer drug delivery, paclitaxel (TAX) shows that the worm-like micelles load and solubilize twice as much drug as spherical micelles. In cytotoxicity tests that compare to the clinically prevalent solubilizer, Cremophor EL, both micellar carriers are far less toxic, and both types of TAX-loaded micelles also show fivefold greater anticancer activity on A549 human lung cancer cells. CONCLUSION: PEO-PCL based worm-like filomicelles appear to be promising pharmaceutical nanocarriers with improved solubilization efficiency and comparable stability to spherical micelles, as well as better safety and efficacy in vitro compared to the prevalent Cremophor EL TAX formulation.},

An approximately linear relation between the activation free energy of viscous flow and the molar conductance at infinite dilution is observed. Our result shows that, although PVA increases the viscosity of the medium, the diffusivity of ions does not decrease, the solvation volume of salt at infinite dilution changes little. Therefore, the increase in diffusivity is connected with the decrease in the free space of ion moving when PVA is added into water. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Abstract: In a recent report, we presented data on the rich and unusual pH-dependent aggregation behavior of a sugar-based (reduced glucose) gemini surfactant (Johnsson et al. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003, 125, 757). In the present study, we extend the previous investigation by introducing a different sugar headgroup (reduced mannose), by varying the spacer between the two main surfactant parts, and by introducing, in one of the surfactants, an amide linkage (instead of an amine linkage) between the headgroup and the unsaturated (C18:1) hydrocarbon tails. The aggregation behavior of these four gemini surfactants has been studied and compared by means of light scattering, cryo-transmission electron microscopy, electrophoretic mobility, and fluorescence measurements. We find that all four surfactants form vesicles near neutral or high pH. However, the vesicles made from the amine-containing geminis are transformed into cylindrical or wormlike micelles at lower pH values (pH {\textless} {\~{}}5.5). The micellization is driven mainly by an increased electrostatic repulsion, caused by the protonation of the tertiary amino groups, and we find that the nature of the sugar or spacer has little influence on this process. At low pH (pH 2), solely small globular micelles are found, and the critical micelle concentration at this pH is about 0.005-0.010 mM for the different amine-containing surfactants. As was expected, the gemini surfactant with the amide instead of the amine functional groups in the headgroup does not undergo the vesicle-to-micelle transition but displays only vesicle formation within the investigated pH range. The electrophoretic mobility measurements on the vesicular samples formed from the amine-containing geminis show that the vesicles are cationic below pH {\~{}}7-7.5; however, the vesicles acquire a substantial negative charge at a higher pH. The most probable explanation for this charge reversal is a strong adsorption (or binding) of hydroxide ions onto the vesicle surface. In accordance with this hypothesis, we find that the vesicles made from the amide-containing gemini are anionic (no protonation) even at a low pH (pH {\textless}5). Using a simple Poisson-Boltzmann model, we are able to describe the obtained -potential profiles reasonably well and derive a hydroxide-ion binding constant (KOH) for the respective systems. We find that the nature of the sugar does have a small influence on KOH. The colloidal stability of all four types of the gemini vesicles seems to be well-described by the classical Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek theory, and the vesicles aggregate/flocculate rapidly in the limit of low surface potential. However, the flocculated vesicles can be easily redispersed by, for example, raising the pH of the solution, and this flocculation/redispersal process is completely reversible.},

Geometrical packing constraints subjected to the aggregated hydrocarbon tails and electrostatics are found to be the dominant contributions to H0, kc and k̄c. In addition, the transition from spherocylindrical micelles to vesicles were investigated in terms of the three parameters and the following simple expressions were derived as criteria for coexistence between micelles and vesicles H0=1/4$\xi$ and 〈N〉ves/〈N〉mic= exp[4$\pi$(kc+k̄c)/kT], where $\xi$ is the thickness of the hydrocarbon part of the film and 〈N〉mic and 〈N〉ves the average aggregation numbers of micelles and vesicles, respectively.

Here, we strictly closed the locality loopholes by observing a 12-hour continuous violation of Bell inequality and concluded that the lower bound speed of `spooky action' was four orders of magnitude of the speed of light if the Earth's speed in any inertial reference frame was less than 10{\^{}}(-3) times of the speed of light.},

The phase behavior in the (water + glycerol)/C12EO8 system as a function of the glycerol content in water at constant temperature is similar to that in the water/C12EO8 system as a function of temperature, and a phase separation (clouding phenomenon) takes place at a high glycerol content. The phase separation was not observed in the other alcohol systems. However, a hexagonal liquid crystal (H-1) changes to an isotropic solution (W-m) in all the systems with increasing the alcohol content. The SAXS measurement for the H-1 and the W-m phases, and the self-diffusion measurement for the W-m phase suggest that the dehydration of the ethylene oxide chain takes place and the aggregates tend to grow with increasing glycerol content. On the other hand, propylene glycol or 1-propanol molecules tend to penetrate into the palisade layer of the aggregates and the micelles are downsized, and eventually they are broken into monomers with increasing the alcohol content. The critical micelle concentration measurement also supports the difference in the alcohol effects on the phase behavior in the aqueous nonionic surfactant system.},

abstract = {The nature and strength of the interactions between a cationic fluorophore, Rhodamine 123 (R123), and surfactants of different head charge are investigated. Series of absorption and fluorescence emission spectra and of fluorescence decays are measured. R123 does not interact with the monomers of both nonionic and cationic surfactants but it presents affinity to their micelles. A partition equilibrium model was proposed and the corresponding equilibrium constants were obtained, as well as the photophysical properties of the dye bound to the micelles. In the case of the cationic surfactants, changes of the fluorescence properties were already observed below the critical micellar concentration (CMC) due to dynamic quenching caused by the free counterions. In the presence of anionic surfactants R123 shows a very different behaviour with dramatic spectral changes below the CMC. The observed variations are attributed to a first, strong interaction between R123 and the surfactant monomers, which yields ionic pairs of singular photophysical properties and dominates at low surfactant concentrations, followed by the association of R123 with the surfactant premicellar and micellar aggregates at higher surfactant concentrations near the CMC. This behaviour results from the competition between the strong electrostatic interactions of the cationic dye with the anionic surfactant head groups and the hydrophobic forces stabilizing the dye inside the micelles. The results of this work illustrate the complex physicochemical and photophysical behaviour of a charged dye in micellar systems, which resembles the expected situation in similar systems such as biological membranes.},

abstract = {The location, orientation, and dynamics of hydrophobic small molecules in lipid membranes are studied through combined use of solution-state (1)H-NMR and MD simulation. 1-Naphthol and 1-methylnaphthalene were adopted as the small molecules with or without hydrophilic groups. The nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE) measurement was performed for large unilamellar vesicles (100 nm in diameter) composed of dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC) and the naphthalene derivative. The transient NOE-SE (spin-echo) scheme previously reported (J. Phys. Chem. B, 2011, 115, 9106-9115) was employed to quantitatively determine the NOE cross relaxation rate constant between DMPC and the naphthalene derivative. The observed NOE shows that both the naphthalene derivatives distribute over a wide domain across the normal of the essentially planar membrane ranging from the hydrophobic core to the hydrophilic headgroup. The experimental NOE information was further refined in combination with the analysis of time correlation functions in MD simulation. It was found that 1-naphthol exhibits a slight preference for pointing its OH group toward the hydrophilic domain of the membrane and that no definite preference can be concluded for the orientation of 1-methylnaphthalene. When 1-naphthol and 1-methylnaphthalene are compared, the NOE is stronger for 1-naphthol due to the restricted motion of the OH group. The slowdown of the 1-naphthol motion is also evidenced by the (1)H spectral line width.},

For both detergents, the increase of N(A) with the net concentration of counterions in the intermicellar aqueous phase ([Y(aq)]) follows the relationship found previously for anionic micelles: log N(A) = logN0+ $\gamma$ log[Y(aq)], where $\gamma$ and N0are constants.

abstract = {The micellization of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) in chloroform in the presence of water was examined. Three scenarios of the reverse micelle formation, the closed, open and Eicke's association models, were considered in the interpretation of the experimental data. The growth of the aggregates was observed through the changes of NMR signals of associated water, probing the microenvironment of the premicellar aggregates and the interior of reverse micelles. This technique if combined with isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) revealed that hydrated surfactant premicellar aggregates are already present at ∼6mMCTAB. NMR, ITCand conductometry were used to determine the critical micelle concentration (cmc) to be ∼40 mMCTAB. It is suggested that the variation of the cmc values reflects the fact that the NMR analysis indicated the beginning of the reverse micelle formation, whereas conductometry and ITC measurements provided the upper limit and an average value of a so-called apparent cmc, respectively. The cmc values were found to be unaffected by the water content. The presence of reverse micelles, the existence of multiple equilibria, and high polydispersity of the samples were evidenced by DOSY NMR spectroscopy. As a result, we validated Eicke's association model, according to which cyclic inverse micelles are formed by a structural reorganization of linear associates within a narrow concentration range, called the apparent cmc. New experimental results have also been gained for micellization of cetyltrimethylammonium chloride (CTAC) in chloroform in the presence of water; a similar mechanism of reverse micelle formation has been suggested.},

abstract = {Here, we present a detailed theoretical model describing the growth of disclike surfactant micelles. The model is tested against light-scattering data for micellar solutions from mixed conventional surfactants and from fluorinated surfactants. Theoretical expressions are derived for the concentration dependencies of the number and mass average aggregation numbers. Central role in the theory is played by the difference between the chemical potentials of a surfactant molecule in cylindrical and discoidal micelles. This difference, scaled with the thermal energy kT, is denoted p. For p{\textless}. 0, the formation of cylindrical (rather than disclike) micelles is energetically favored. For p{\textgreater}. 0 disclike micelles are formed, but their growth is limited due to the rise of their positive peripheral energy. Because of that, disclike micelles can be observed in a relatively narrow interval, 0. {\textless}. p{\textless}. 0.1, and in a limited concentration range. Three sets of light-scattering data for different surfactants were processed. It is remarkable that in all cases the best fit gives small positive values of p, in agreement with the theoretical predictions. The model predicts that a strong increase in the viscosity of a surfactant solution should happen upon the transformation of disclike micelles into cylindrical ones at small variations in p. The model can be used for analyzing the shape and size of micelles in various surfactant solutions. The fact that typical disclike micelles form only in the special case 0. {\textless}. p{\textless}. 0.1 shows why such micelles represent a relatively rare form of stable surfactant self-assembly. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Sum-frequency vibrational spectroscopy, with the help of surface pressure-area ($\pi$-A) isotherm, was used to study lipid Langmuir monolayers composed of molecules with positively and negatively charged headgroups as well as a 1:1 neutral mixture of the two. The spectral profiles of the CH(x) stretch vibrations are similar for all monolayers in the liquid-condensed (LC) phase. They suggest a monolayer structure of closely packed alkyl chains that are nearly all-trans and well oriented along the surface normal. In the liquid-expanded (LE) phase, the spectra of all monolayers appear characteristic of loosely packed chains with significant gauche defects. The OH stretch spectra of interfacial water for both positively and negatively charged monolayers are significantly enhanced in comparison with a neutral water interface, but the phase measurement of SFVS indicates that OH in the two cases points toward the bulk and the interface, respectively. The enhancement results mainly from surface-field-induced polar ordering of interfacial water molecules. For a charge-neutral monolayer composed of an equal number of positively and negatively charged lipid molecules, no such enhancement is observed. This mixed monolayer exhibits a wide range of LC/LE coexistence region extended to very low surface pressure and its CH(x) spectral profile in the coexistence region resembles that of the LC phase. This result suggests that in the LC/LE coexistence region, the mixed monolayer consists of coexisting LC and LE patches in which oppositely charged lipid molecules are homogeneously mixed and dispersed.},

Our approach has been well-supported by Isothermal Titration Calorimetry (ITC). Using the ITC analyses and theoretical calculations, we have conclusively proved that the shape of the micelles change from spherical (at its Critical Micelle Concentration) to cylindrical because the micelles grow in a uni-axial manner. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.

In the dilute regime, the micellar growth is larger than expected from mean-field or scaling models. The results obtained in the vicinity of the overlap concentration suggest the presence of large aggregates, with size {\textgreater}100 nm, possibly micellar rings or microgels. In the semidilute regime, the relationship between the zero shear viscosity and the surfactant concentration is described by a power law with an exponent in agreement with the mean-field model of linear micelles. The methods based on the analysis of the temperature dependence of the complex shear modulus to provide a measure of the scission energy are discussed.},

abstract = {We have used two different force field models to study concentrated dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)–water solutions by molecular dynamics. The results of these simulations are shown to compare well with recent neutron diffraction experiments using H/D isotope substitution [A. K. Soper and A. Luzar, J. Chem. Phys. 97, 1320 (1992)]. Even for the highly concentrated 1 DMSO : 2 H2O solution, the water hydrogen–hydrogen radial distribution function, gHH(r), exhibits the characteristic tetrahedral ordering of water–water hydrogen bonds. Structural information is further obtained from various partial atom–atom distribution functions, not accessible experimentally. The behavior of water radial distribution functions, gOO(r) and gOH(r) indicate that the nearest neighbor correlations among remaining water molecules in the mixture increase with increasing DMSO concentration. No preferential association of methyl groups on DMSO is detected. The pattern of hydrogen bonding and the distribution of hydrogen bond lifetimes in the simulated mixtures is further investigated. Molecular dynamics results show that DMSO typically forms two hydrogen bonds with water molecules. Hydrogen bonds between DMSO and water molecules are longer lived than water–water hydrogen bonds. The hydrogen bond lifetimes determined by reactive flux correlation function approach are about 5 and 3 ps for water–DMSO and water–water pairs, respectively, in 1 DMSO : 2 H2O mixture. In contrast, for pure water, the hydrogen bond lifetime is about 1 ps. We discuss these times in light of experimentally determined rotational relaxation times. The relative values of the hydrogen bond lifetimes are consistent with a statistical (i.e., transition state theory) interpretation.},

@article{Freire2010,
abstract = {The nature and strength of the interactions between a cationic fluorophore, Rhodamine 123 (R123), and surfactants of different head charge are investigated. Series of absorption and fluorescence emission spectra and of fluorescence decays are measured. R123 does not interact with the monomers of both nonionic and cationic surfactants but it presents affinity to their micelles. A partition equilibrium model was proposed and the corresponding equilibrium constants were obtained, as well as the photophysical properties of the dye bound to the micelles. In the case of the cationic surfactants, changes of the fluorescence properties were already observed below the critical micellar concentration (CMC) due to dynamic quenching caused by the free counterions. In the presence of anionic surfactants R123 shows a very different behaviour with dramatic spectral changes below the CMC. The observed variations are attributed to a first, strong interaction between R123 and the surfactant monomers, which yields ionic pairs of singular photophysical properties and dominates at low surfactant concentrations, followed by the association of R123 with the surfactant premicellar and micellar aggregates at higher surfactant concentrations near the CMC. This behaviour results from the competition between the strong electrostatic interactions of the cationic dye with the anionic surfactant head groups and the hydrophobic forces stabilizing the dye inside the micelles. The results of this work illustrate the complex physicochemical and photophysical behaviour of a charged dye in micellar systems, which resembles the expected situation in similar systems such as biological membranes.},

Surface tension measurements show that Pluronics in their non-aggregated state better interact with the anionic surfactant C10OS than with cationic and non-ionic ones. The presence of the two Pluronics induces the same lowering of the aggregation number of C10OS as shown by fluorescence quenching measurements. The number of polymer chains necessary to bind each C10OS aggregate has been estimated to be ∼6 for PE6200 and ∼2 for 25R4. Furthermore, this surfactant also induces the same increment in the gyration radius of the polymers as revealed by viscosimetry. Calorimetric results have been reasonably reproduced by applying a simple equilibrium model to the aggregation processes. {\textcopyright} 2006.},

In the presence of SDS, SB3-12, SB3-16 and Triton X-100 the 8QOH chelates are only kinetically stable in solution and after 24 h, the precipitation is almost quantitative. Conversely, upon addition of the cationic surfactant hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTABr), the absorbance of the complex remains constant even after at least six months. The interaction of the ligand 8QOH (and of the (8QO)2Zn(II) complex) with the cationic surfactant was studied by ultraviolet and NMR spectroscopy and 8QOH has a p Ka= 9.05 in the presence of the cationic surfactant and the ligand intercalates in the micelle, being preferentially located near the headgroup of the micelle. Although the solubilization site of the (8QO)2Zn(II) complex is similar to that of 8QOH, the interaction of the aromatic moiety with the CTA+headgroup is much stronger, due to the increased electron density in the aromatic ring of the ligand. As a consequence of this interaction, sphere to rod transition and an increase in microscopic and macroscopic viscosity are observed. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The apparent and partial molar enthalpies, apparent molar volumes, and adiabatic compressibilities at 298 K of the aqueous solutions of the cationic gemini surfactants propanediyl-alpha,omega-bis(octyldimethylammonium bromide) (8-3-8) and propanediyl-alpha,omega-bis(dodecyldimethylammonium bromide) (12-3-12) have been measured as a function of concentration. The trends of the partial molar enthalpies versus concentration are the first well documented thermodynamic evidence of sphere to rod transition in the micellar phase, involving a detectable quantity of heat, and allow the determination of the change in enthalpy associated with this transition. The changes in enthalpies upon micellization and for the sphere to elongated micelles transition, DeltaH(s)(--{\textgreater})(r), have been obtained from the experimental data by using a pseudo-phase transition approach: -1.5 kJ mol(-1) for 8-3-8 and -3.9 kJ mol(-1) for 12-3-12. No evidence of the above transition is found in the trends of volumetric properties versus m. The apparent adiabatic molar compressibilities for the compounds under investigation are also reported here for the first time: a negative group contribution for the methylene group is evaluated, when the surfactants are present in solution as a single molecule, reflecting its solvation structure. In the micellar phase, the -CH(2)- group contribution becomes positive. A value of 1.17 x 10(-3) cm(3) bar(-1) mol(-1) for the change in adiabatic molar compressibility upon micellization is obtained. The lower values of the methylene group contributions to the volumetric properties for the monomers support the hypothesis of partial association of the chains before the cmc.},

Arabinoxylan derived oligosaccharides purified by HPAEC-PAD on an analytical column, by single injections, were analyzed with nano-probe NMR and MALDI-TOF MS to provide full structural assignment. The NMR data were obtained with a 500 MHz NMR spectrometer equipped with a1H-observe nano-probe. Both one- and two- dimensional experiments on arabinoxylan samples in the low nanomole range were performed, including1H-1H DQF-COSY,1H-1H TOCSY and1H-1H ROESY. These experiments allowed, in combination with MALDI-TOF MS and literature NMR data, a complete structural determination of several tetra-, penta-, hexa- and heptasaccharides.

In the range of 00.5 mole fraction (x) of added Brij 30 to a 30 mM SDS solution, the mixed micellar aggregation number (Nagg) changed from 65 to 171, and the zeta potential of the micelles varied from 60 to 15 mV. The change in size was acompanhied by a 2-fold increase in the internal micellar viscosity, indicating that addition of the nonionic surfactant with similar alkyl chain enhances the surfactant packing in the mixed aggregate. The reduction of the electrical surface potential causes a proportional decrease of the binding constant of the cationic dye acridine orange. The change in temperature from 15 to 45 oC of a solution with x = 0.5 results in a decrease in the Nagg from 175 to 128, but the SDS to Brij 30 monomers ratio remains constant. This fact is typical of ionic micelles, opposite to the usual behavior of pure nonionic micellar aggregates with an oxyethylene surfactant headgroup.},

However, to date, little experimental research has focused on the cognitive processes that may promote religious disbelief. The present studies apply a dual-process model of cognitive processing to this problem, testing the hypothesis that analytic processing promotes religious disbelief. Individual differences in the tendency to analytically override initially flawed intuitions in reasoning were associated with increased religious disbelief. Four additional experiments provided evidence of causation, as subtle manipulations known to trigger analytic processing also encouraged religious disbelief. Combined, these studies indicate that analytic processing is one factor (presumably among several) that promotes religious disbelief. Although these findings do not speak directly to conversations about the inherent rationality, value, or truth of religious beliefs, they illuminate one cognitive factor that may influence such discussions.},

abstract = {Sodium salicylate (NaSal) is added to aqueous solutions of cetyl trimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) to convert spherical micelles to wormlike micelles, thus producing an effective drag-reducing agent. A theoretical understanding of why NaSal is so effective at causing this transformation has not been developed at this time. Using a model that combines aspects of free energy models with simulations, we show change in ordering of the amphiphiles within the micelles of different curvatures. The way NaSal transforms the spherical micelles to wormlike micelles is by insertion of the salicylate ion into the surfactant shell, which reduces the preferred mean curvature of the surfactant shell and thus causes the transformation. This mechanism is different from that of a counterion shell formed in the presence of electrolytes. These models help us to understand the interactions between amphiphiles and additives in the micellar headgroups. The results of this model agree with some experimentally observed trends and help to account for others. Comparisons of our models with predictions based only on free energy models highlight the significance of accounting for intramicellar ordering in calculating micelle free energies. In general, such a model can predict the effect of the inclusion of other organic additives into micellar structures.},

abstract = {Sugar surfactants have recently attracted considerable interest. Here we report a systematic light and neutron scattering investigation of aqueous solutions of the alkyl polyglucoside C8/10G1.5. The system exhibits a transition from globular to giant wormlike micelles upon the addition of hexanol. We can finely tune the extent of micellar growth and in particular reach conditions where solutions of relatively short cylinders exist, which dramatically grow into giant wormlike micelles upon the addition of small amounts of hexanol. While considerable progress has been made in the understanding of interaction effects in solutions of spheres or large polymer-like objects, limited information exists for short flexible cylinders. An important reason for this is the lack of good model systems. Here we now demonstrate that the APG system provides us with an ideal set of data for an analysis of micellar growth and interactions in solutions with cylindrical particles of moderate axial ratios.Weapply theoretical expressions for the static structure factor derived from Monte Carlo computer simulations of semiflexible polymers with excluded volume interactions,whichallowusto self-consistently incorporate micellar interactionsandgrowthinaquantitative analysis of the light and neutron scattering data.},

abstract = {Controlling the morphological characteristics of micellar solutions is important for surfactant performance and for achieving desired properties. In this work we study how monovalent anions of the lyotropic series affect micellization, micellar transitions, and micellar growth of the cationic surfactant N-cetyl pyridinium chloride (CPyCl), with the aim of achieving a tool to methodically tune these self-assembly characteristics. For the first time, a set of ions of the Hofmeister series were studied by combining indirect (surface tension, conductivity, optical absorption, viscosity, dynamic light scattering) and direct-imaging cryogenic-transmission electron microscopy (cryo-TEM). Following recent literature on anionic surfactants, we considered the pyridinium headgroup as a chaotropic cation, interacting with cosmotrope and chaotrope anions (Cl-, Br-, NO3-, ClO3-). We show that the micelles' structure is strongly influenced by both the nature and concentration of added anions and their location in the lyotropic series, but the lyotropic number by itself cannot explain all the effects measured. Especially interesting was the relatively small effect of the chlorate ion on the CMC, but its large effect on micellar transition and growth. We further test the influence of a hydrotrope on the first and second CMC and micellar growth, and compare it with the data obtained with the inorganic salts. ?? 2009 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {The oscillating drop and bubble analyzer (ODBA) is an experimental set-up based on the measurement of capillary pressure under static and dynamic conditions. It allows studies of slow and fast dynamic surface and interfacial tensions, following different growing and oscillating drop or bubble protocols, as well as determination of the dilational interfacial visco-elasticity of liquid interfacial layers. For the visco-elasticity studies, drops or bubbles are subjected to harmonic oscillations of area or volume in a broad frequency range, and the resulting harmonic capillary pressure response is analyzed by Fourier analysis. Also, transient relaxations can be easily performed, which are of particular importance for isodense systems. The limits of applicability for highly dynamic conditions are given by the hydrodynamics of the fluid flow inside the capillary tip and the pressure cell which depend on fluid properties, capillary tip size, and geometry. For the growing drop protocol, additional phenomena during drop formation and detachment play a significant role. For oscillating drops or bubbles, the highest accessible frequencies also depend on the absolute drop size and applied oscillation amplitude. In this work, the capability of the technique for measurements in the frequency range between 1 and 100. Hz are discussed, and elasticity values at up to 80. Hz were measured for the liquid-liquid interface. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V..},

abstract = {This paper describes the influence of counterions on the unidirectional growth of micelles formed by alkylpyridinium surfactants in aqueous solution. It is shown that the growth of spherical micelles to form wormlike micelles is strongly dependent on counterion structure. More hydrophobic counterions induce the formation of wormlike micelles at lower surfactant concentrations. Next to hydrophobicity and the type of substituent, the substitution pattern of the aromatic ring plays the most important role in micellar growth. The formation of a network of entangled, elongated wormlike micelles by alkylpyridinium surfactants with o-hydroxybenzoate and p-chlorobenzoate counterions is discussed in terms of surfactant structure. It is concluded that, next to counterion structure, the microenvironment of the counterion (substituent) in the Stern region and the structure of the surfactant monomer (i.e., the surfactant cation) play the most important role in the formation of these elongated wormlike micelles. Headgroup effects are proposed to be the main driving force for this phenomenon.},

abstract = {Micellar solutions of several amphiphiles in water, without added electrolytes, have been studied by small-angle X-ray scattering methods, bawd upon intensity measurements on an absolute scale. The concentration range goes froin 5y0 to the appearance of a liquid crystalline phase (30 to 40{\%} in most cases). Several arnphiphiles have been studied a t different temperatures: sodium lauryl sulfate (27 and 70'), sodium lauratc (70°), myris-tate (80°), palmitate (80'), stearate (go'), and oleate (KaO, 27'), and cetyltrimethylarn-monium chloride (CTACl, 27') and bromide (27, 50 arid 70'). The interpretation of the expcrirncrital curves is discussed. It is shown that over various concentration ranges the micelles may be assuiiied to be monodisperse, their size and shape being independent of concentration. The analysis of the curves leads to the determination of the structure of the micelles. The structure is dependcnt on various parameters: nature of the amphi-phile, temperature, arid conccntration. In most systems the micelles are spherical a t low coriccritratioris arid become rod-like a t high concentration. In two cases, the structure appears to be independent of the concentration: CTACl micelles are spherical from 5 to 38{\%}; KaO micelles are rod-like from 4 to 20{\%}. This polymorphism is discussed. Introduction For several years one of the main activities of our laboratory has been the study by X-ray diffraction of various structures of association colloids. Until now we have becn mainly interested in liquid crystals, especially those of concentrated (generally over 30{\%}) aqueous systeins.2 We are now reporting on the struc-ture of iiiiccllar solutions which occur at lower concen-trations. We may note that, although the structure of micelles is quite well known, a t least for a few systems, at very low concentrations close to the critical riiicclle con-centration (c.rn.c.), there is little definitive inforniatiori about higher conccntrations, where the effects of cor-relations betwccn rnicellcs becoiiie predoiniiiant and the interpretation of hydrodynamic arid light-scattering experiments becomes uncertain. Structural analysis is bcst, done in this region of concentrations by small angle X-ray scattering, a technique which has been used by several authors. AIcl3aiii" and Harkiris"'l were pioneers in this field, even though their work is now only of historical interest sirice the interpretation of experimental findings lacked a theoretical b a s i {\~{}} . {\~{}} -{\~{}} Others'J have attempted a more rigorous interpreta-tion of the experimental curves by trying to recori-struct their form on the basis of models of spherical micelles showing niutual correlations. It proved, however, to be difficult to distinguish the effect of the shape of micelles from that of their correlations. We have undertaken this problem by using an iin-proved sinall-angle X-ray scattering technique, de-veloped in our laboratory, which is based upon intensity measurements on an absolute scale.},

Then the thermodynamic parameters of micellization ($\Delta$G m 0 , $\Delta$H m 0 , and $\Delta$S m 0) were calculated by applying a mass-action model equation. On the basis of the ITC results, the CMCs and thermodynamic parameters were also estimated at 293.15 K, which were basically consistent with the results from the conductivity method. According to the Turro−Yekta method, the micelle aggregation number (N agg) of R n HTACl was determined through static luminescence quenching, and found that the decreased temperature, the elongation of the alkyl chain length or the increased concentration of R n HTACl could lead to an increase of the N agg .},

abstract = {We study the influence of micellar kinetics on the rheological behavior of worm-like micelles composed of tri-block copolymers of ethylene oxide and propylene oxide ( EO 20 PO 70 EO 20 ) in an aqueous solution containing KCl and ethanol. The kinetics of the micelles are adjusted by changing the ethanol concentration, according to a previous study in which the lifetime of the micelles was shown to decrease exponentially with increasing ethanol concentration. At higher ethanol concentrations (15 vol {\%} EtOH), the worm-like micelles behave like Maxwell fluids at low frequencies, but have an upturn at higher frequencies, probably due to Rouse or breathing relaxation modes. At low ethanol concentrations (5 and 8 vol {\%} EtOH) where the lifetime of the micelles is long, the rheological behavior is clearly non-Maxwellian, revealing a spectrum of relaxation times. The slow, block copolymer dependent growth of the micelles leads to scaling of viscosity with surfactant concentration, which varies with time. In this slow breaking regime, stirring of the solutions causes an increase of the viscosity, which slowly decreases once stirring is stopped. This apparent increase of the viscosity may be induced by the linking of ring-like micelles or by the formation of clusters of worm-like micelles (non-equilibrium structures), which disassemble when stirring is stopped.},

Fundamentally, the behavior is associated with the balance of charge between the surfactant and the aromatic anion. In this paper, the same approach was used to investigate the rheological behavior of WLM formed when solutions of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (C16TAB) and ortho-hydroxycinnamate (OHCA) are combined. This co-solute has two ionizable groups, with pKas of 4.15 and 9.71. In order to verify the influence of the two ionic forms of OHCA on the rheological behavior, solutions of C16TAB and OHCA were studied on three pHs, 7, 8, and 9. The results are analyzed by considering the reptation and breaking-recombination mechanisms.},

abstract = {The well-known Vogel-Fulcher-Tammann-Hesse equation (VFTH, log10$\eta$=A+B/(T-T0), $\eta$ in Pa s and T in K) has been extensively used in the description {\&} characterization of cooperative molecular motion by means of the temperature dependence with viscosity, $\eta$, e.g., using Angell's classification. Experimental evidence has been pointed out for the statistical correlation between its three adjustable parameters A, B and T0, which may bring questions on the reliability of fitted VFTH parameters. In this work VFTH equation was applied over a wide temperature range (between glass transition temperature, Tgand the melting point, Tm) for 38 oxide glasses, considering simple, binary and ternary compositions of silicates and borates systems. These systems include strong, moderate and fragile glass-forming liquids. For this task was used the Levenberg-Marquart non-linear fitting procedure to find viscosity parameters B and T0, maintaining A=-5 fixed, intending to reduce the number of adjustable parameters. Despite this restriction, the VFTH equation has shown to adjust very well to experimental data in wide temperature range. Simple criteria were developed in the past to characterize glass-forming liquids, one of them (due to Angell) is the strong-fragile classification. In this work we apply correspondence analysis (CA) to verify the correlation between B and T0parameters as well as between Tgand Tm. CA is a descriptive and exploratory technique designed to analyze simple multi-way tables containing some measure of correspondence between rows and columns. From these results is possible to map either borate (and almost fragile) or silicate (usually strong up to near fragile) systems. As a statistical tool, CA corroborates correlation mainly between B and T0and justifies the use of B, T0and Tgas the main parameters for the fragility indexes m=BTg/(Tg-T0)2and D=B/T0. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The solubilisation capacities of micellar solutions of diblock and triblock copolymers composed of hydrophilic poly(ethylene oxide) and hydrophobic poly(styrene oxide) have been compared using the poorly water-soluble drug griseofulvin as a model solubilisate. Our results showed an increase of solubilisation capacity (expressed as mg griseofulvin per gram of hydrophobic block) with temperature and, for spherical micelles, with core volume before reaching limiting values. A change of micelle shape from spherical to cylindrical (or worm-like) resulting from an increase in micelle aggregation number was accompanied by a further enhancement of solubilisation capacity. Comparison with the solubilisation of the same drug in micellar solutions of block copolymers of poly(ethylene oxide) and poly(1,2-butylene oxide) showed that the solubilisation capacity of a poly(styrene oxide) block was approximately four times that of a poly(1,2-butylene oxide) block for spherical micelles. Solubilisation capacity at 25°C was approximately doubled when griseofulvin was incorporated into a copolymer melt and micelles initially formed from the drug-loaded melt at 65°C rather than by loading the drug into pre-micellised solution at 25°C in the usual manner. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The small-angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) patterns of a number of linear polyethylene (PE) and polyoxymethylene (POM) samples have been measured and compared to the intensity functions of one-dimensional paracrystalline lattices. It was found that the ratio of the angular positions of the second and first scattering maxima ($\theta$2/$\theta$1) is generally less than or equal to 2.0, implying that the paracrystalline lattice statistics are symmetric or moderately skewed to larger periods. The Bragg spacing (“long period”) of such samples is within 3{\%} of the identity period of the macrolattice. With quenched POM the ratio $\theta$2/$\theta$1 is substantially larger than 2.0, which indicates either extremely asymmetric lattice statistics or coexisting structures within the material. From consideration of the reduced widths of the first scattering maxima, it was found that some broadening is present in addition to that from the paracrystallinity. This excess broadening could result from a finite lattice length of ∼1000 {\AA}. The need for careful experimental technique for obtaining the actual position of the scattering maximum is emphasized. In addition, it is demonstrated that the scattering curve and the correlation function of the system yield essentially the same apparent structural periods.},

The results indicated that these tomato ketchups behave as non-Newtonian fluids semi-solid and have a definite yield stress. The relationship between eta(eff) and temperature of all the tomato ketchup brands under investigation was examined. Significantly higher correlation was found between heff and temperature. The heff values decrease with an increase in temperature. Oscillatory test data revealed weak gel-like ( dispersion structure) behaviour of the ketchup: the magnitudes of G' were higher than those of G", and both increased with oscillatory frequency. The effect of temperature on the viscosity can be described by means of an Arrhenius-type equation. The flow activation energy for viscous flow depends on the chemical composition; the flow activation energy increases with the total solids contents. Chemical, physical and sensory tests for tomato ketchups were made},

abstract = {Addition of methylsalicylic acid and hydroxybenzoic acid to 20 mM aqueous solutions of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) causes spherical micelles to undergo a transition to wormlike micelles. Shear rheometry and cryo-transmission electron microscopy (cryo-TEM) are combined to investigate the relationship between the colloid microstructures and theology as a function of acid concentration. Cryo-TEM micrographs show that the spherical-to-wormlike micelle transition is not abrupt. Both types of micelles coexist over a range of acid concentration. When the majority of the surfactant is in wormlike micelles, the solutions exhibit viscoelastic behavior as a result of micellar entanglement. The shear and extensional viscosities of these solutions undergo flow thinning, flow thickening, and then flow thinning with increasing flow rates. We interpret the micellar transition in terms of the effect the added acid has on the ratio of the effective area of the hydrophilic head group and the effective area of the hydrophobic chain of the surfactant. The effective area of the hydrophilic head group is decreased by association with the carboxylic acid group, and the effective area of the hydrocarbon chain is increased by penetration of the phenyl moiety of the acid, Both of these factors favor changing the surfactant monolayer from spherical to cylindrical curvature. From trends we observed for 3-, 4- and 5-methylsalicylic acid and 3- and 4-hydroxybenzoic acid, we conclude that increasing the effective area of the hydrocarbon chain is an important factor in the transition mechanism.},

abstract = {Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) is a powerful classical method that enables researchers in many fields to study the thermodynamics of molecular interactions. Primary ITC data comprise the temporal evolution of differential power reporting the heat of reaction during a series of injections of aliquots of a reactant into a sample cell. By integration of each injection peak, an isotherm can be constructed of total changes in enthalpy as a function of changes in solution composition, which is rich in thermodynamic information on the reaction. However, the signals from the injection peaks are superimposed by the stochastically varying time-course of the instrumental baseline power, limiting the precision of ITC isotherms. Here, we describe a method for automated peak assignment based on peak-shape analysis via singular value decomposition in combination with detailed least-squares modeling of local pre- and postinjection baselines. This approach can effectively filter out contributions of short-term noise and adventitious events in the power trace. This method also provides, for the first time, statistical error estimates for the individual isotherm data points. In turn, this results in improved detection limits for high-affinity or low-enthalpy binding reactions and significantly higher precision of the derived thermodynamic parameters.},

abstract = {The variations in enthalpy ($\Delta$fHWLM) and critical concentrations associated with the formation of wormlike micelles (WLMs) from combinations of tetradecyltrimethylammonium bromide (C14TAB) and various aromatic co-solutes were determined using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). Three groups of aromatic molecules were investigated: neutral (phenol), benzoate derivatives and cinnamate derivatives. In addition, the thermal stabilities of the WLMs (of hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide, C16TAB) and the aromatic co-solutes of the three groups were investigated by measuring the temperatures at which the WLMs break and lose their ability to produce hydrodynamic drag reduction. A comparison of the results was used to establish correlations between the spontaneity of WLMs formation, their thermal stability and the molecular structure of the aromatic co-solutes. A characteristic thermal pattern with four steps was observed when WLMs are formed, that depended on the co-solute structure. Micellar growth was found to be an exothermic process, related to the fusion of the end caps allied with the incorporation of more co-solutes. The co-solutes that had negative charge and were able to maintain planar configuration demonstrated stronger interactions and also showed higher thermal stability through drag reduction.},

To this end, we have developed a simple and effective route to form smart, multi-response wormlike micelles based on a synthesized surfactant, N-cetyl-N,N-diisopropanolammonium bromide (CDIAB). Moreover, we provide new insight into the effects of synergy on this smart wormlike micelle. Rheological measurements were used to study the morphology of the wormlike micelles; 1H NMR spectroscopy and density functional theory (DFT) calculations were employed to investigate the molecular arrangements and mechanism of the synergy involved in the reversible reactions of pH-response and CO2-response of the micelles in solution. Based on the abovementioned results, it is encouraging to discover that binding energy and electrostatic interaction are the basic driving forces in the formation of wormlike micelles. Moreover, stable viscoelastic behavior was observed in the CDIAB system, with strong binding energy and electrostatic interactions. It is highly anticipated that the synergy observed in this surfactant will be of particular interest due to its novel mechanism and unique properties.},

This review deals with the intermicellar interaction and stability of pure and binary mixed system of conventional and gemini surfactants. Since the colloidal stability is strictly dependent upon the micelle-micelle interaction, both electrostatic and van der Waals interactions have been taken into account and discussed according to DLVO theory. The effects of miscellaneous structural parameters such as head group, chain length, and counter ion on intermicellar interaction are studied which may affect the size and shape of micellar systems determining the surface charge density. Also, the medium effects including ionic strength, temperature, electrolyte conditions such as salts and ionic liquids on intermicellar interaction have been discussed. Additionally, the effects on non-DLVO forces such as hydration, hydrophobic, and steric interactions on micellar stability have been studied. The interaction between aggregates of binary mixed systems of cationic surfactants with Triton X-100 has been reported for the first time. The hydrodynamic radius (Rh0), aggregation number, and micellar diffusion coefficient have been calculated using the linear combination theory. The electrostatic and van der Waals attraction contributions have been also calculated and their magnitude was compared indicating that the van der Waals attractive contribution is often negligible compared to repulsive electrostatic interaction.},

abstract = {The term gel is central to many scientific fields, including polymer science, biophysics, and supramolecular chemistry. In polymer science, a gel is said to be formed when polymer chains are linked into a permanent three-dimensional (3-D) network by cross-links that are either chemical bonds or strong physical associations. Linear chains in the absence of such cross-links are expected to form a network that is only defined by topological (entanglement) interactions between the chains; accordingly, such a network is expected to show viscoelastic rather than gel-like, rheology. On the other hand, many systems consisting of extended nanoscale fibers/chains (e.g., supramolecular organo- and hydro-gels, wormlike micelles, and protein filaments like F-actin) do exhibit the rheology of permanent gel networks, even in the absence of putative cross-links. We argue here that linear fibers can indeed form gels through their topological interactions alone, i.e., without cross-links, provided the fibers are sufficiently long (contour length much larger than cross-sectional size), sufficiently stiff (worm-like or rod-like) and temporally persistent, i.e., "unbreakable". This hypothesis is supported by recent experimental and theoretical studies. In particular, we review recent experiments on wormlike micelles that show a smooth rheological transition from viscoelastic (relaxing) to gel (non-relaxing) behavior upon varying temperature.},

abstract = {The critical micelle concentration (cmc) of TX-100 in formamide (FA) was determined from surface tension measurements as functions of temperature and NaCl concentration. At 25 °C, cmc was also determined by the fluorescence method. For the sake of comparison, micellization parameters of TX-100 were also determined in water. cmc, aggregation number, and standard free energy of micellization in FA are about 400 times higher, 10 times lower, and 2 times higher than in water, respectively. On increasing the temperature, cmc in FA shows a slight increase, whereas in water it decreases. The logarithm of relative cmc decreases linearly with added NaCl concentration in both FA and water, and the rate of this decrease is surprisingly equal in the two solvents. Micellization of TX-100 is exothermic in FA, but endothermic in water. The cloud point (CP) of TX-100 was determined in FA + water medium and that in pure FA was estimated to be ∼233 °C when [TX-100] = 0.15 mol kg-1. Surface excess values of TX-100 were calculated from Gibbs and Langmuir adsorption isotherms. Values of standard free energy of adsorption calculated from the Rosen-Aronson equation and from the Langmuir adsorption isotherm are comparable. The ratio of the surface tension of the solvent to that at the cmc has been demonstrated as a novel scale for measuring solvophobicity. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

The cationic surfactants, dodecyltrimethylammonium bromide, tetradecyltrimethylammonium bromide, and hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide or cetyltrimethylammonium bromide were used. Adsorption studies were performed utilizing HiSil 233 precipitated silica as the substrate. The thermodynamics of micellization were studied at 28, 30, and 35 degrees C using ITC. DeltaHdil was calculated and graphed versus concentration in order to determine DeltaHmic and critical micelle concentration. From these data, DeltaGmic and DeltaSmic were also determined and found to be in agreement with values previously determined using traditional temperature-variation methods. The thermodynamics of adsorption were also determined at the above temperatures using ITC. Using the results, the heat of displacement, Qdisp, and enthalpy of displacement, DeltaHdisp, were calculated. A plot of DeltaHdisp as a function of concentration was generated and used to interpret the mechanism of adsorption in the four regions of a typical cationic surfactant adsorption isotherm.},

abstract = {1H and 13C NMR chemical shifts are exquisitely sensitive probes of the local environment of the corresponding nuclei. Ultimately, direct determination of the chemical shifts of sterols in their membrane environment has the potential to reveal their molecular interactions and dynamics, in particular concerning the hydrogen-bonding partners of their OH groups. However, this strategy requires an accurate and efficient means to quantify the influence of the various interactions on chemical shielding. Herein the validity of Hartree-Fock and DFT calculations of the 13C and 1H NMR chemical shifts of cholesterol and ergosterol are compared with one another and with experimental chemical shifts measured in solution at 500 MHz. A computational strategy (definition of basis set, simpler molecular models for the sterols themselves and their molecular complexes) is proposed and compared with experimental data in solution. It is shown in particular that the effects of hydrogen bonding with various functional groups (water as a hydrogen-bond donor and acceptor, acetone) on NMR chemical shifts in CDCl3 solution can be accurately reproduced with this computational approach.},

HLB values published by Griffin were compared with those obtained by calculations from theoretic chemical formulas. Griffin HLB values of polyoxyethylene alkyl ethers, polyoxyethylene monoesters and propylene glycol monoesters coincide with those obtained from such theoretical chemical formulations. These results demonstrate that, for these surfactants, Griffin did not experimentally obtain their HLB values, but instead calculated them from theoretic formulae. For the calculation of the HLB values of glycerol monostearate, sorbitan fatty acid esters and polyoxyethylene sorbitan fatty acid esters, Griffin's assumptions were possibly based upon the mean saponification values of the ester and the acid of the fatty acid. It is concluded that the HLB values of non-ionic surfactants were not rigorously defined. Moreover, Griffin could not demonstrate the validity of the assumption that individual required HLB values can be added up to obtain the overall required HLB value of an oil mixture. The HLB and required HLB values published by Griffin should only be taken as approximate guidelines. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

This combination of experimental techniques enables independent determination of the microstructural length scales (persistence, entanglement, interaction, and contour) that govern the rheological properties. Comparison and contrast of the effect of a hydrotropic salt (NaTosylate) with that of a screening electrolyte (NaCl) demonstrates the influence of micellar charge on the persistence length and, hence, the microstructure and rheology. Surfactant concentration and composition and electrolyte concentration and composition systematically affect the self-assembled microstructure such that a transition in rheological behavior from nonionic wormlike micelles to polyelectrolytes can be spanned.},

abstract = {Video games are a ubiquitous part of almost all children's and adolescents' lives, with 97{\%} playing for at least one hour per day in the United States. The vast majority of research by psychologists on the effects of "gaming" has been on its negative impact: the potential harm related to violence, addiction, and depression. We recognize the value of that research; however, we argue that a more balanced perspective is needed, one that considers not only the possible negative effects but also the benefits of playing these games. Considering these potential benefits is important, in part, because the nature of these games has changed dramatically in the last decade, becoming increasingly complex, diverse, realistic, and social in nature. A small but significant body of research has begun to emerge, mostly in the last five years, documenting these benefits. In this article, we summarize the research on the positive effects of playing video games, focusing on four main domains: cognitive, motivational, emotional, and social. By integrating insights from developmental, positive, and social psychology, as well as media psychology, we propose some candidate mechanisms by which playing video games may foster real-world psychosocial benefits. Our aim is to provide strong enough evidence and a theoretical rationale to inspire new programs of research on the largely unexplored mental health benefits of gaming. Finally, we end with a call to intervention researchers and practitioners to test the positive uses of video games, and we suggest several promising directions for doing so.},

Varying the weight percent, phi, of surfactants from 0.1 {\%} to 10 {\%}, both dilute and semidilute regimes were studied. Above the crossover concentration phi* approximately 0.3 {\%}, the viscoelastic properties are described by an almost ideal Maxwell relaxator. The overall rheological data are found to scale with the surfactant concentration with exponents close to those predicted from a recent stress relaxation model applied to living polymers. In addition, at high angular frequency, the complex elastic modulus results are interpreted in terms of crossover between the regimes of reversible scission and of breathing of the polymer-like chains. Contrary to earlier reports, the total average length of the micellar aggregates is found to increase with surfactant concentration as: L(phi)BAR approximately phi0.25-0.4.},

The interaction between DMSO and mater molecules is stronger compared with interaction between water and polar head group of phospholipid membrane.

abstract = {The hydrated electron-the species that results from the addition of a single excess electron to liquid water-has been the focus of much interest both because of its role in radiation chemistry and other chemical reactions, and because it provides for a deceptively simple system that can serve as a means to confront the predictions of quantum molecular dynamics simulations with experiment. Despite all this interest, there is still considerable debate over the molecular structure of the hydrated electron: does it occupy a cavity, have a significant number of interior water molecules, or have a structure somewhere in between? The reason for all this debate is that different computer simulations have produced each of these different structures, yet the predicted properties for these different structures are still in reasonable agreement with experiment. In this Feature Article, we explore the reasons underlying why different structures are produced when different pseudopotentials are used in quantum simulations of the hydrated electron. We also show that essentially all the different models for the hydrated electron, including those from fully ab initio calculations, have relatively little direct overlap of the electron's wave function with the nearby water molecules. Thus, a non-cavity hydrated electron is better thought of as an "inverse plum pudding" model, with interior waters that locally expel the surrounding electron's charge density. Finally, we also explore the agreement between different hydrated electron models and certain key experiments, such as resonance Raman spectroscopy and the temperature dependence and degree of homogeneous broadening of the optical absorption spectrum, in order to distinguish between the different simulated structures. Taken together, we conclude that the hydrated electron likely has a significant number of interior water molecules.},

abstract = {Viscoelastic properties of aqueous solutions of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) containing sodium salicylate (NaSal) were examined by varying the CTAB, CD, and NaSal, CS;, concentrations. The results were compared with those of flexible-chain polymer solutions. With increasing salt-to-detergent ratio, CSCD-1, up to a certain critical value close to 1 for the solutions of a given CD, the rheological behavior changed from that of low molecular weight polymer solutions in which the polymer chains are not entangling to behavior similar to that of high molecular weight polymer solutions in which polymer chains are fully entangling. These results suggest that threadlike micelles composed of CTAB/NaSal complexes began to form as CSCD-1 increased, resulting in an entanglement network exhibiting pronounced viscoelasticity. However, at high CSCD-1 above the critical value, their behavior can be represented by a Maxwell model with a constant plateau compliance JN0 and a single relaxation time $\tau$m. Interestingly, JN0 was proportional to CD-2.2 but independent of CSCD-1, but the relaxation time $\tau$m decreased with increasing CSCD-1. The complex dependence of $\tau$m of all the solutions at high CSCD-1 may be reduced to a single composite function of CSCD-1/2.

abstract = {Everyone enjoys seeing the cloudy white fog generated when solid carbon dioxide (dry ice) is placed in water. Have you ever wondered what physical and chemical processes occur to produce this fog? When asked this question, many chemical educators suggest that the fog is produced when atmospheric water vapor condenses on cold carbon dioxide gas that sublimes through the water. But this explanation is incorrect, as shown by Luck and co-workers in an article previously published in J. Chem. Educ. Herein, we extend this previous work by presenting some simple experiments and explanations that provide a model for how the fog forms when dry ice is placed in water. Many of these experiments can be carried out using materials found at the pharmacy, grocery store, or hardware store. The explanations involved draw from many concepts taught in general chemistry such as vapor pressure and Le Châ telier's principle.},

The authors still remember their astonishment when they first became aware of a viscoelastic surfactant solution. This was many years after our group had started investigations on surfactants. But all of the solutions we had encountered until that time had behaved normally. Some of the phenomena which will be discussed are also encountered in solutions of polymers. Due to their high molecular weight one expects to find properties which are different from the properties of low molecular weight solutions and does not find them so surprising. Surfactant solutions, however, are aqueous solutions of small molecules with typical molecular weights of 200 to 400. For some of our experiments even dilute solutions were used which contained only up to one percent of surfactant.},

abstract = {It is shown that phospholipid dispersions with a few percent of diacylphosphocholine PC in water can be swollen to single-phase lyotropic liquid crystalline L$\alpha$-phases by the addition of co-solvents like glycerol, 1,3-butyleneglycol BG or 1,2-propyleneglycol PG. The birefringent L$\alpha$-phases contain small unilamellar and multilamellar vesicles if the temperature of the samples is above the Krafft-Temperature Tmof the phospholipid. When such transparent birefringent viscous samples are cooled down below Tmthe samples are transformed into birefringent gels. Cryo-TEM and FF-TEM measurements show that the bilayers of the vesicles are transformed from the liquid to the crystalline state during the transformation while the vesicle structure remains. The bilayers of the crystalline vesicles form adhesive contacts in the gel. Pulsed-field gradient NMR measurements show that two different kinds of water or co-solvent can be distinguished in the gels. One type of solvent molecules can diffuse like normal solvent in a continuous bulk phase. A second type of water diffuses much more slowly. This type of solvent is obviously trapped in the vesicles. The permeability of the crystalline vesicles for water and solvent molecules is much lower in the crystalline state than in the fluid state. Maximum swelling of the diacylphosphocholin dispersions occurs when the refractive index of the solvent is matched to the refractive index of the bilayers. The attraction between the bilayers is at a minimum in this state and the liquid crystalline L$\alpha$-phase's undulation forces between the bilayers push the bilayers apart. On transformation to the gel state the crystalline bilayers assume a high elastic bending rigidity. Undulations of the bilayers are now suppressed, and the bilayers can form adhesive contacts. Oscillating rheological measurements show that the gels with only 1{\%} of phospholipids can have a storage modulus of 1000 Pa. The gels are very brittle. They break when they are deformed by a few percent. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Addition of lipophilic nonionic amphiphiles, such as short EO-chain polyoxyethylene dodecyl ether (C12EOn, n = 1-4) and monolaurin (ML), to the dilute micellar solution of sucrose hexadecanoate (P1695) induces a sharp increase in viscosity that is attributed to the one-dimensional micellar growth. With successive addition of the nonionics, the viscosity gradually decreases and, eventually, a phase separation occurs. In the maximum-viscosity region of the mixed systems, a viscoelastic solution with a rheological behavior typical of the interwoven network of wormlike micelles is obtained. The oscillatory shear behavior of the systems can be described by the Maxwellian model in the region of low shear frequency. The ability of the lipophilic nonionics to induce micellar growth in the mixed system decreases in the following order: ML ≈ C12EO1 ≈ C 12EO2 {\textless} C12EO3 {\textless} C 12EO4. A similar effect of the hydropilic group is observed in the sucrose dodecanoate (SM1200)/ C16EOn aqueous system, although the micellar growth is comparatively less favorable, and a sharp increase in viscosity occurs near the boundary of the micellar phase. The microstructural change with surfactant mixing ratio in the representative P1695/C12EO4 system, based on the results of dynamic light scattering and rheological measurements, is discussed. A change from spherical to wormlike micelles, followed by branching and further separation of branching points as disklike micelles, precursors of the lamellar liquid crystal phase, is proposed.},

abstract = {Glycerol (Gly) and 1,3-butanediol (13BD) are widely used as a cryoprotective reagent. Although these compounds have similar chemical structures, their interfacial behavior is not necessarily the same. Frozen aqueous 13BD gives discrete liquid inclusions dispersed in an ice matrix, whereas frozen aqueous Gly forms the film-like liquid phase spread over the entire ice crystal surface. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements of Gly/water at 253 K indicate that the chemical shifts of both water and alcohol OH protons move upfield with increasing concentration of Gly regardless of whether the solution is frozen ({\textless}48 wt {\%} Gly) or not (≥48 wt {\%} Gly). In contrast, the chemical shifts remain constant over the entire concentration range for 13BD. Gly forms a molecularly homogeneous mixture with water in any ratio and also interacts with ice similar to liquid water; this leads to the continuous changes in the chemical shifts. However, 13BD and water mainly form individual clusters, which weakly interact with ice. Therefore, the molecular environments are unchanged with the alcohol concentration in this system. The spin–spin relaxation times also indicate that Gly more strongly interacts with ice than 13BD. Raman spectra and the self-diffusion coefficients of water and the alcohols also suggest that 13BD and water molecules form individual clusters in their mixtures and that this tendency is marked at lower temperature and in the presence of ice.},

This cationic surfactant has the ability to self-assemble into giant wormlike micelles in the presence of an electrolyte, such as KCl. In salt-free solutions, the mixture of the two surfactants gave rise to spherical micelles. The scattering curves obtained were fitted with a polydisperse core-shell model combined with a Hayter Penfold potential. The inner and outer radii were found to be dependent on the surfactant ratio. In the presence of KCl, mixed wormlike micelles were formed. However, further addition of C(18)E(18) promoted the breaking of the micellar worms with the appearance of a structure peak in the scattering curves. In addition, it was found that the low shear viscosity is decreased upon addition of the alcohol ethoxylate nonionic surfactant. These findings are in good qualitative agreement with the Cryo-TEM images. The results show that the addition of the nonionic surfactant to the system is a method of controlling the worm length.},

For solution compositions rich in C12E6, the evolution of micelle size with composition exhibits a pronounced maximum, in qualitative, agreement with the theoretical predictions of Shiloach and Blankschtein [Langmuir 1998, 14, 7166], but with some important quantitative differences which are discussed. The solubilization of the alkane, hexadecane, into the mixed surfactant micelle suppresses the micelle growth with changing solution composition. For micelles rich in C12E6, hexadecane is solubilized predominantly into the palisade layer of the micelles, favoring small spherical micelles. The micellar growth with changing solution composition arises from changes in the balance between the headgroup and steric contributions to the free energy of micellization, and the addition of alkane further alters that balance in favor of small spherical micelles.},

In combination with conventional rheometric techniques, we use our microfluidic rheometer to study the properties of a shear-banding solution of cetylpyridinium chloride (CPyCl) with sodium salicylate (NaSal) and a nominally shear-thinningsystem of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) with NaSal across many orders of magnitude of deformation rates ( 10 - 2 ≤ $\gamma$ {\textperiodcentered} ≤ 10 4 s - 1 ). We use $\mu$-PIV to quantify the local kinematics and use the birefringence microscopy system in order to obtain high-resolution measurements of the changes in molecular orientation in the wormlike fluids under strong deformations in a microchannel. The FIBmeasurements reveal that the CPyCl system exhibits regions of localized, high optical anisotropy indicative of shear bands near the channel walls, whereas the birefringence in the shear-thinning CTAB system varies more smoothly across the width of the channel as the volumetric flow rate is increased. We compare the experimental results to the predictions of a simple constitutive model, and we document the breakdown in the stress-optical rule as the characteristic rate of deformation is increased.},

Structural evaluation of the system revealed that penetration of water molecules into the micelle was restricted to the headgroup region, leaving a 12 {\AA} water-free hydrocarbon core. Water molecules near the headgroup exhibit a distortion of the water-water hydrogen bonding network due to headgroup oxygen- water hydrogen bond formation. The dynamic implications of this distortion are manifested in the decay of the dipole autocorrelation function, $\Phi$(t) and translational diffusion coefficient. We observe that while the translational diffusion coefficient of water molecules in the first solvation shell of the micelle is reduced by less than a half of its value in bulk water, the slow component of the reorientational correlation function is slowed by one or two orders of magnitude.},

The aggregates were characterized by a novel spin-probe-partitioning electron paramagnetic resonance (SPPEPR) method and dynamic light scattering (DLS). Results of high-precision fitting of the second-harmonic EPR spectra of the small spin probe di-tert-butyl nitroxide (DTBN) in these aggregates together with viscosity, conductivity, and DLS showed that, at pH ∼ 7.54, MTNa formed micelles and MPNa vesicles and MTNa exhibited a pH-induced micelle to vesicle transition as pH was lowered toward 6. MTNa, at pH ∼ 7.54, formed small micelles at low concentrations that transformed to long worm-like micelles for concentrations ≥ 0.05 M, accompanied by a 30-fold increase in solution viscosity. The hydrodynamic radii from DLS confirmed the presence of small micellar aggregates of radius ∼ 2 nm in MTNa at pH ∼ 7.54 at the lower concentrations, with coexisting micelles (∼2 nm) and vesicles (∼50 nm) at pH near 6.5, vesicles (radii ∼ 70 nm) at pH near 6, and large vesicles (85 nm) in MPNa at pH ∼ 7.60. Both MTNa and MPNa precipitated upon reduction of pH below 6 and below 7, respectively. The rate of transfer of DTBN between the aqueous phase and the aggregate was calculated from the high-field Lorentzian linewidths of the electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra. The activation energy for the transfer determined from the temperature dependence of the rate of transfer is 12.7 kJ/mol for MTNa vesicles (pH ∼ 6) and 20.6 ± 1.3 kJ/mol for MPNa (pH ∼ 7.60). The pH-induced transformations were reversible.},

abstract = {The addition of positively charged, 30 nm diameter silica nanoparticles to cationic wormlike micellar solutions of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide and sodium nitrate is studied using a combination of rheology, small angle neutron scattering, dynamic light scattering, and cryo-transmission electron microscopy. The mixtures are single phase up to particle volume fractions of 1{\%}. The addition of like-charged particles significantly increases the wormlike micelle (WLM) solution's zero shear rate viscosity, longest relaxation time, and storage modulus. The changes are hypothesized to originate from a close association of the particles with the micellar mesh. Small angle neutron scattering measurements with contrast matching demonstrate associations between particles mitigated by the WLMs. The effective interparticle interactions measured by SANS can explain the observed phase behavior. Dynamic light scattering measurements confirm the dynamic coupling of the particles to the micellar mesh.},

abstract = {The effect of hydrophobic and hydrophilic co-solutes on the rheological properties of wormlike micelles of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) and sodium salicylate (NaSal) or sodium bromide (NaBr) was investigated. Monomeric (ethanol, 2-propanol, benzene and benzylic alcohol) and polymeric species (poly(ethylene oxide), poly(vinyl alcohol) and poly(propylene oxide), respectively PEO, PVA and PPO) of varying molecular weight were studied in order to assess the effect of co-solute 'length' on the interactions with the wormlike micelles. Rheological properties were characterised by the plateau modulus G0 and the relaxation time $\tau$R obtained from fits to the Maxwell model, and by the zero-shear viscosity $\eta$0. The rheological properties were unaltered by the addition of all hydrophilic solutes (up to 20mM). With hydrophobic co-solutes instead, both $\eta$0 and $\tau$R decreased considerably, while G0 was unaffected. The effects were particularly remarkable with PPO for concentrations as low as 5mM (ca. 0.3gL-1), and $\tau$R was seen to follow an exponential decrease with polymer Mw. The effect of the aromatic solutes (benzene and benzyl alcohol) on the rheology was highly dependent on the counterions used to induce micellar growth (Sal- or Br-), revealing a different type of interaction. Surprisingly, small-angle neutron scattering and Cryo-TEM measurements showed that the drastic changes observed in the rheology were not correlated to any visible structural change. Therefore the strong decrease in viscosity and relaxation time are to be attributed to other mechanisms than micellar break-up or rod-to-sphere transition. {\textcopyright} 2010.},

abstract = {The morphological changes of micelles composed of triblock copolymer of ethylene oxide and propylene oxide (EO20PO70EO20) in the presence of different inorganic salts and ethanol have been investigated using dynamic light scattering (DLS), rheometry, and cryogenic transmission electron microscopy (cryo-EM). The following salts were studied: KF, KCl, KI, LiCl, and CsCl. In the presence of KF, KCl, and CsCl, spherical and wormlike micelles coexist. LiCl and KI have little influence on the morphology of the micelles, whereas KF has the most pronounced effect. In agreement with the well-known Hoffmeister anion salt series, F- has the strongest effect of the three anions studied (F-, Cl-, I-). In contrast, the effectiveness of the cation type does not follow the original Hoffmeister cation series. The addition of ethanol to the KCl micellar solutions leads to the formation of more or longer wormlike micelles, which start to interact at certain copolymer concentrations depending on the volume fraction of ethanol added. Both the dilute and the semidilute regimes of the wormlike micelles were studied. The length of the micelles reaches a maximum value at around 8-10 vol {\%} ethanol, after which it decreases again. At higher ethanol concentrations (18 vol {\%}), spherical micelles are formed. Conclusions from this study enhance our understanding of the role played by ethanol and salts in the formation of micelle-templated mesoporous materials, such as SBA-15.},

abstract = {The linear viscoelastic response of erucyl bis(hydroxyethyl) methylammonium chloride with added KCl has been studied as a function of temperature and nonpolar solvent addition. The plateau modulus is independent of temperature from 25 to 40 degrees C, in contrast to previous studies with salicylate counterions that showed a plateau modulus increasing with temperature over this range. The average micelle length, L, predicted by the model of Cates, depends experimentally on Escis/kBT, where Escis is the scission energy of the chain and kBT is the Boltzmann constant times the absolute temperature. With ethanol addition, the calculated average contour length, L, decreases by a factor of 4 as ethanol concentration varies from 0 to 1.3 M. This corresponds to an apparent energy for scission, Escis, decrease from 81 +/- 8 to 74 +/- 7 kJ/mol. On the other hand, only 80 mM of hexane is required to cause a decrease in Escis to the same level, and for hexane addition levels above 70 mM a disruption in the plateau modulus indicates the disruption of the rodlike structure. The correspondence between the effect of temperature and the effect of solvent addition allows the development of "solvent/temperature" superposition rules to predict the rheology of these viscoelastic fluids at elevated temperatures.},

abstract = {Molecular dynamics simulations and infrared spectroscopy were used to determine the hydrogen bond patterns of glycerol and its mixtures with water. The ability of glycerol/water mixtures to inhibit ice crystallization is linked to the concentration of glycerol and the hydrogen bonding patterns formed by these solutions. At low glycerol concentrations, sufficient amounts of bulk-like water exist, and at low temperature, these solutions demonstrate crystallization. As the glycerol concentration is increased, the bulk-like water pool is eventually depleted. Water in the first hydration shell becomes concentrated around the polar groups of glycerol, and the alkyl groups of glycerol self-associate. Glycerol-glycerol hydrogen bonds become the dominant interaction in the first hydration shell, and the percolation nature of the water network is disturbed. At glycerol concentrations beyond this point, glycerol/water mixtures remain glassy at low temperatures and the glycerol-water hydrogen bond favors a more linear arrangement. High glycerol concentration mixtures mimic the strong hydrogen bonding pattern seen in ice, yet crystallization does not occur. Hydrogen bond patterns are discussed in terms of hydrogen bond angle distributions and average hydrogen bond number. Shift in infrared frequency of related stretch and bend modes is also reviewed.},

abstract = {Mimicking giant cylindrical micelles in solution, self-assembled linear polymers are studied by Langevin dynamics in shear flow. The kinetics of chain scission (with rate ks per bond) and chain end recombination (with rate kr) is modelled by associating to each monomer two arms for binding. A switch of pair potentials (from bounded to unbounded or vice versa) is tried with a fixed attempt frequency per arm $\omega$ modelling the effect of a potential barrier along a reaction path. The opening of a selected bond or the bonding between two selected free ends are accepted or not according to a Monte Carlo algorithm. We are interested in the coupled effects of the shear flow and the scission-recombination kinetics on the structural and rheological properties of this micellar system. Our study is performed in semi-dilute and dynamically unentangled regime conditions with an average chain size L0. The explored $\omega$ range is chosen sufficiently high for the lifetime of the average size chain to remain shorter than its intrinsic (Rouse) longest relaxation time $\tau$R=$\tau$0L02. Central to our analysis is the concept of dynamical unit of size $\Lambda$=($\tau$0ks)- 1/3{\textless}L0, the chain fragment for which the lifetime $\tau$$\Lambda$ and the Rouse time are equal. Shear thinning, chain orientation and bond stretching are found to depend upon the reduced shear rate , while the average micelle size is found to decrease with increasing shear rate, independently of the height of the barrier of the scission-recombination process.},

abstract = {The orientational binding of substituted benzoate anions at the cetyltrimethyl ammonium interface is assigned from the NMR chemical shift measurements of both the aromatic anion protons and the surfactant methylene protons. Aromatic protons oriented into the hydrophobic region of the micelle demonstrate upfield chemical shifts of greater than 0.1 ppm. The surfactant methylene protons show a corresponding induced aromatic ring current shift from the benzoate anions which allows a qualitative assignment of the degree of penetration. The NMR data indicate the observed rheological phenomenon of viscoelasticity for three mixed micellar systems containing cetyltfimethyl ammonium bromide and the substituted benzoates, sodium m-toluate, sodium p-toluate, or potassium o-phthalate. The rhelogical effect is prominently observed for 1:1 stoichiometric ratios of CTAB:X-benzoate. The prolate mixed micellar aggregates have CMC values of 0.22, 0.24, and 0.26 ± 0.05 mM for o-phthalate, m-toluate, and p-toluate (1:1 ratio). The NMR data on the CTAB: o-toluate mixed micelle which does not become viscoelastic (CMC = 0.45 mM) demonstrate that o-toluate anion does penetrate the micellar interface. The NMR chemical shift data indicate which anions are stabilizing the interface sufficiently to facilitate the sphere to rod phase transition. {\textcopyright} 1990.},

abstract = {Tribocharged polymers display macroscopically patterned positive and negative domains, verifying the fractal geometry of electrostatic mosaics previously detected by electric probe microscopy. Excess charge on contacting polyethylene (PE) and polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) follows the triboelectric series but with one caveat: net charge is the arithmetic sum of patterned positive and negative charges, as opposed to the usual assumption of uniform but opposite signal charging on each surface. Extraction with n-hexane preferentially removes positive charges from PTFE, while 1,1-difluoroethane and ethanol largely remove both positive and negative charges. Using suitable analytical techniques (electron energy-loss spectral imaging, infrared microspectrophotometry and carbonization/colorimetry) and theoretical calculations, the positive species were identified as hydrocarbocations and the negative species were identified as fluorocarbanions. A comprehensive model is presented for PTFE tribocharging with PE: mechanochemical chain homolytic rupture is followed by electron transfer from hydrocarbon free radicals to the more electronegative fluorocarbon radicals. Polymer ions self-assemble according to Flory-Huggins theory, thus forming the experimentally observed macroscopic patterns. These results show that tribocharging can only be understood by considering the complex chemical events triggered by mechanical action, coupled to well-established physicochemical concepts. Patterned polymers can be cut and mounted to make macroscopic electrets and multipoles.},

abstract = {Expressions have been derived from which the spontaneous curvature (H(0)), bending rigidity (k(c)), and saddle-splay constant (k(c)) of mixed monolayers and bilayers may be calculated from molecular and solution properties as well as experimentally available quantities such as the macroscopic hydrophobic-hydrophilic interfacial tension. Three different cases of binary surfactant mixtures have been treated in detail: (i) mixtures of an ionic and a nonionic surfactant, (ii) mixtures of two oppositely charged surfactants, and (iii) mixtures of two ionic surfactants with identical headgroups but different tail volumes. It is demonstrated that k(c)H(0), k(c), and k(c) for mixtures of surfactants with flexible tails may be subdivided into one contribution that is due to bending properties of an infinitely thin surface as calculated from the Poisson-Boltzmann mean field theory and one contribution appearing as a result of the surfactant film having a finite thickness with the surface of charge located somewhat outside the hydrophobic-hydrophilic interface. As a matter of fact, the picture becomes completely different as finite layer thickness effects are taken into account, and as a result, the spontaneous curvature is extensively lowered whereas the bending rigidity is raised. Furthermore, an additional contribution to k(c) is present for surfactant mixtures but is absent for k(c)H(0) and k(c). This contribution appears as a consequence of the minimization of the free energy with respect to the composition of a surfactant layer that is open in the thermodynamic sense and must always be negative (i.e., k(c) is generally found to be brought down by the process of mixing two or more surfactants). The magnitude of the reduction of k(c) increases with increasing asymmetry between two surfactants with respect to headgroup charge number and tail volume. As a consequence, the bending rigidity assumes the lowest values for layers formed in mixtures of two oppositely charged surfactants, and k(c) is further reduced in anionic/cationic surfactant mixtures where the surfactant in excess has the smaller tail volume. Likewise, the reduction of k(c) is enhanced in mixtures of an ionic and a nonionic surfactant where the ionic surfactant has the smaller tail. The effective bilayer bending constant (k(bi)) is also found to be reduced by mixing, and as a result, k(bi) is seen to go through a minimum at some intermediate composition. The reduction of k(bi) is expected to be most pronounced in mixtures of two oppositely charged surfactants where the surfactant in excess has the smaller tail in agreement with experimental observations.},

abstract = {The formation and rheological behavior of a viscoelastic wormlike micellar solution in an aqueous solution of a nonionic fluorinated surfactant, perfluoroalkyl sulfonamide ethoxylate, of structure C8F17SO2N(C3H7)(CH2CH2O)10H was studied. Temperature-induced viscosity growth is observed even at low-surfactant concentration (approximately 1 wt {\%}), and viscosity reaches the maximum at a temperature T(eta)-max. Upon successive increases in the temperature, the viscosity decreases, and ultimately a phase separation occurs. Small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) measurements confirm the presence of cylindrical aggregates at low temperature, which undergo continuous one-dimensional growth with increasing temperature, and ultimately, an indication of a slight lamellarlike structural pattern is observed, which probably comes from the formation of micellar joints or branching. Such changes in the microstructure result in a decrease in the viscosity and stress-relaxation time, while the network structure is retained; the trends in the evolution of shear modulus (Go) and relaxation time (tauR) with temperature are in agreement with this. With increased surfactant concentration, the temperature corresponding to the viscosity maximum (T eta-max) in the temperature-viscosity curve shifts to lower values, and the viscosity at temperatures below or around T eta-max increases sharply. A viscoelastic solution with Maxwellian-type dynamic rheological behavior at low-shear frequency is formed, which is typical of entangled wormlike micelles. Rheological parameters, eta(o) and Go, show scaling relationships with the surfactant concentrations with exponents slightly greater than the values predicted by the living-polymer model, but the exponent of tauR is in agreement with the theory. Dynamic light-scattering measurements indicate the presence of fast relaxation modes, associated with micelles, and medium and slow modes, associated with transient networks. The disappearance of the slow mode and the predominance of the medium mode as the temperature increases support the conclusions derived from SAXS and rheometry.},

Two breaks on the plot appeared for all temperature, which suggest two micellar transitions. This has been corroborated by surface tension measurements. The first transition concentration occurs at the critical micelle concentration (CMC), whilst the second critical concentration (so-called transition micellar concentration, TMC) is due to a sphere-to-rod micelles transition. The dependence of CMC and TMC on the temperature allows the computation of the corresponding thermodynamic functions: Gibbs free energy, enthalpy and entropy changes. For the CMC, enthalpy and entropy increments were found that decrease with the temperature values. However, an anomalous behavior was obtained for the TMC, where both $\Delta$S0and $\Delta$H0values raised with the temperature increase. However, for both transitions, an (enthalpy + entropy) compensation is observed. These results will be compared with similar systems reported in the literature.},

abstract = {The properties of ionic micelles are affected by the nature of the counterion. Specific ion effects can be dramatic, inducing even shape and phase changes in micellar solutions, transitions apparently related to micellar hydration and counterion binding at the micellar interface. Thus, determining the hydration and dynamics of ions in micellar systems capable of undergoing such transitions is a crucial step in understanding shape and phase changes. For cationic micelles, such transitions are common with large organic anions as counterions. Interestingly, however, phase separation also occurs for dodecyltrimethylammonium triflate (DTATO micelles in the presence of sodium triflate (NaTf). Specific ion effects for micellar solutions of dodecyltrimethylammonium chloride (DTAC), bromide (DTAB), methanesulfonate (DTAMs), and triflate (DTATO were studied with dielectric relaxation spectroscopy (DRS), a technique capable of monitoring hydration and counterion dynamics of micellar aggregates. In comparison to DTAB, DTAC, and DTAMs, DTATf micelles were found to be considerably less hydrated and showed reduced counterion mobility at the micellar interface. The obtained DTATf and DTAMs data support the reported central role of the anion's -CF3 moiety with respect to the properties of DTATf micelles. The reduced hydration observed for DTATf micelles was rationalized in terms of the higher packing of this surfactant compared to that of other DTA-based systems. The decreased mobility of Tf- anions condensed at the DTATf interface strongly suggests the insertion of Tf- in the micellar interface, which is apparently driven by the strong hydrophobicity of -CF3.},

abstract = {This paper revises the general idea about the role of intermicellar and intramiceller interactions in inhibiting fusion of self-assembled surfactant micelles. Fusion and fission of micelles are usually thought to be limited by different mechanisms. While fission is accepted to be controlled by surface instabilities (intramicellar interactions), fusion is commonly thought to be rate limited by the barrier to the close approach between two micelles due to the steric or Coulombic repulsions (intramicellar interactions). Here we describe the role of electrostatic repulsions in inhibiting fusion and fission kinetics in self-assembled micelles. We use stopped flow-fluorescence technique with hydrophobic pyrene to quantify fusion and fission in ionic/nonionic mixed micelles (Triton X-100/SDS). We show that the fusion and fission rates decrease with the same tendency with increasing the fraction of the ionic charges, while their ratio remains constant. Our results are interpreted to mean that, in slightly charged micelles, fusion shares the same limiting step with fission, which most likely involves surface instabilities and intramiceller interactions.},

abstract = {The effect of sodium salicylate (NaSal) additives on micellar structure and dynamics in aqueous solution of dodecyltrimethylammonium bromide (DTAB) has been studied by means of1H-NMR and quasielastic neutron scattering (QENS) measurements. The molar ratio R (=CNaSal/CDTAB) dependence on the peak shape of the NMR spectra revealed that a sphere-to-rod-like micellar transition took place around R=0.5. The chemical shift for the1H atoms of the alkyl group of DTA+ion gave the information for the binding site of Sal-ion in micelles. The R dependence on the chemical shift for the aromatic group of Sal-ion clarified the selective binding feature of Sal-ion in micelles. The dynamic structure factor, S(Q,E), of the micellar molecules exhibited apparent broadening of the elastic scattering peak which was fitted well to a single Lorentzian function. The self-diffusion coefficient D was obtained from the Q-dependence of the HWHM of the Lorentzian function. The slope of D vs. R curve changed around the transition ratio (R=0.5), reflecting the dynamic slowing down of the local relaxational motion of the micellar molecules in rod-like micelles. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The complexation between charge-neutral block copolymers and oppositely charged surfactants was investigated by light scattering experiments and by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). The copolymer was poly(sodium acrylate)-b-poly(acrylamide) and the surfactant dodecyltrimethylammonium bromide (DTAB). In a previous report, we had shown that the copolymers and the surfactants coassembled spontaneously into colloidal complexes. Depending on the charge ratio, the complexes were either single surfactant micelles decorated by copolymers or core-shell hierarchical structures. ITC was performed in order to investigate the thermodynamics of the complex formation. Titrations of copolymers by surfactants and of surfactants by copolymers revealed that the electrostatic coassembly was an endothermic reaction, suggesting a process dominated by the entropy of the counterions. Here, we found that the thermodynamic quantities associated with the reaction depended on the mixing order. When surfactants were added stepwise to copolymers, the titration was associated with the formation of single micelles decorated by a unique polymer. Above a critical charge ratio, the micelles rearranged themselves into 100 nm colloidal complexes in a collective process which displayed the following features: (i) the process was very slow as compared to the time scale of Brownian diffusion, (ii) the thermodynamic signature was a endothermic peak, and (iii) the stoichiometry between the positive and negative charges was modified from n = 0.48 (single micelles) to 0.75 (core-shell complexes). When copolymers were added stepwise to surfactants, the titration resulted in the formation of the core-shell aggregates only. In both experiments, the amount of polyelectrolytes needed for complex formation exceeded the number required to compensate the net micellar charge, confirming the evidence of overcharging in the complex formation.},

This is the first self-assembled polymer recently reported as a hydrodynamic drag reducer for hydrocarbons. The rheology of diluted and semidiluted EHUT solutions can be tuned by specific interactions between the chains, modulated by the nature of the solvent and the presence of additives. In this article, rheological, thermal and SANS measurements were performed in order to investigate the competition between EHUT self-assembly and its interaction with specific molecules (benzene, benzyl alcohol, and ethanol) that can interact with EHUT unimers via hydrogen bonds and $\pi$-$\pi$ interactions. No substantial rheological, thermal, or structural effect is observed when benzene is added to the systems. However, ethanol and benzyl alcohol interact with EHUT unimers through hydrogen bonds, drastically decreasing the viscoelasticity of the solutions. In addition, benzyl alcohol can interact with EHUT polymers by $\pi$-stacking interactions, playing an important role in tuning the rheological properties of the systems.},

The maximum relative content on DAO for a stable mixed monolayer is a molar ratio of X(DAO) = 0.5. Brewster angle microscopy (BAM) reveals a high homogeneity at the micrometer level for the mixed monolayer in equimolar proportion (X(DAO) = 0.5), whereas the appearance of domains occurs for lower content of DAO, i.e., X(DAO) = 0.2 and 0.1. The aggregation of the DAO headgroup leads to well-defined H-aggregates at the air/water interface for those mixed monolayers with a low content of DAO. However, for the mixed monolayers enriched in DAO, e.g., X(DAO) = 0.5, the molecular crowding prevents the formation of defined supramolecular structures. Molecular organization and tilting of the DAO headgroup is quantitatively analyzed by in situ UV-visible reflection spectroscopy. The formation of H-aggregates of the DAO headgroup can be reversibly tuned with the applied surface pressure. A molecular mechanism for the conformational rearrangement of the DAO molecule is proposed using RM1 quantum semiempirical calculations.},

abstract = {The solubilization of benzene and toluene in micellar solutions and the effects on the micellization and micelle size of ethylene oxide-propylene oxide triblock copolymers were investigated by dynamic light scattering (DLS), small angle neutron scattering (SANS), and 2D NMR spectroscopy. The copolymeric surfactants have the same size as the middle hydrophobic polypropylene oxide block (Mol. Wt. 3250) and varying polyethylene oxide end blocks (30, 40 and 50{\%}). The solubilization and the properties of the micelles in the presence of the solubilizates were investigated; the results reveal that the more hydrophobic copolymer showed better solubilization. The cloud points of the copolymers decreased in the presence of oils; the depression in the cloud point is due to the formation of an electron donor-acceptor complex. DLS shows that the effect of benzene is dominated at high oil concentration. SANS data show that the micelles remain spherical in shape and that the micellar core size does not change with higher benzene concentration; observed changes in the low scattering vector region could be because of some small amount of benzene clusters formed at higher benzene concentration. Finally, the locus of solubilization of the oils in the copolymer micelles was determined via 2D NMR experiments. In all cases, significant nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy (NOESY) cross peaks were observed that appeared to correlate well with the expected loci of these solubilizates in micelles. Hence, the noninvasive NOESY technique provides important information on the location of the aromatic solubilizates in these copolymer micelles that depends on the structure of the oils. {\textcopyright} AOCS 2011.},

abstract = {Dielectric spectroscopy measurements for aqueous urea solutions were performed at 298 K through a concentration range from 0.5 to 9.0 M with frequencies between 200 MHz and 40 GHz. Observed dielectric spectra were well represented by the superposition of two Debye type relaxation processes attributable to the bulk-water clusters and the urea-water coclusters. Our quantitative analysis of the spectra shows that the number of hydration water molecules is approximately two per urea molecule for the lower concentration region below 5.0 M, while the previous molecular dynamics studies predicted approximately six water molecules. It was also indicated by those studies, however, that there are two types of hydration water molecule in urea solution, which are strongly and weakly associated to the urea molecule, respectively. Only the strongly associated water was distinguishable in our analysis, while the weakly associated water exhibited the same dynamic feature as bulk water. This implies that urea retains the weakly associated water in the tetrahedral structure and, thus, is not a strong structure breaker of water. We also verified the model of liquid water where water consists of two states: the icelike-ordered and dense-disordered phases. Our dielectric data did not agree with the theoretical prediction based on the two-phase model. The present work supports the argument that urea molecules can easily replace near-neighbor water in the hydrogen-bonding network and do not require the presence of the disordered phase of water to dissolve into water.},

Infrared (IR) and1H,13C and15N nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopic measurements indicate coordination of the ligand to gold(I) through the nitrogen atom. Studies based on DFT confirmed nitrogen coordination to gold(I) as a minimum of the potential energy surface with calculations of the hessians showing no imaginary frequencies. Thermal decomposition starts at temperatures near 160°C, leading to the formation of Au0as the final residue at 1000°C. The gold(I) complex with 2-mercaptothiazoline (Au-MTZ) is soluble in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), and is insoluble in water, methanol, ethanol, acetonitrile and hexane. The antibacterial activities of the Au-MTZ complex were evaluated by an antibiogram assay using the disc diffusion method. The compound showed an effective antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus (Gram-positive) and Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Gram-negative) bacterial cells. Biological analysis for evaluation of the cytotoxic effect of the Au-MTZ complex was performed using HeLa cells derived from human cervical adenocarcinoma. The complex presented a potent cytotoxic activity, inducing 85{\%} of cell death at a concentration of 2.0 $\mu$mol L-1. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {We present a systematic study of the self-assembly of wormlike micelles (WLMs) comprised of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) and sodium nitrate (NaNO3) in aqueous solution as a function of CTAB concentration, NaNO3 concentration, and temperature throughout the dilute and semi-dilute regions of the phase diagram where linear micelles are observed. Combining measurements using isothermal titration calorimetry, rheometry, flow-birefringence, cryo-transmission electron microscopy (cryo-TEM), and small angle neutron scattering (SANS) enables complete characterization of the structure, thermodynamics, and rheology of CTAB/NaNO3 micelles. The addition of NaNO3 is found to increase the micellization enthalpy as well as the micellar scission energy, resulting in the elongation and growth of WLMs. We find quantitative agreement between the scission energy determined from rheology and the enthalpy of micellization determined from ITC, as well as for contour lengths extracted from rheology and SANS. At fixed molar ratio of NaNO3 and CTAB, the solution rheology exhibits scaling consistent with dilute, semi-dilute overlapping, and semi-dilute entangled regimes typically found in polymer solutions, as confirmed by cryo-TEM and SANS. The transition between these scaling regimes coincides with the structural transitions identified by SANS. The results validate the relationship between structural parameters and rheological behavior underlying theories for ionic WLMs. {\textcopyright} 2010.},

abstract = {A polyhydroxamicalkanoate (PHA) polymer containing the functional groups hydroxamic acid and carboxylic acid with the ability to accelerate dephosphorylation reactions is proposed. The methodology used to prepare this polymer favored the position of the two functional groups next to each other, which allows for the cooperativity between these groups. This cooperative effect has an important role when one wants to mimic enzymes. The catalytic effect promoted by the polymer was evaluated on the cleavage of the bis(2,4-dinitrophenyl) phosphate (BDNPP) and diethyl 2,4-dinitrophenyl phosphate (DEDNPP) esters. Indeed, PHA was very efficient and promiscuous because it increased the rate of both reactions by a factor of up to 10(6)-fold. Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) experiments showed that the presence of PHA aids the formation of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTABr) micelles. Thus, the effect of the cationic surfactant CTABr on the dephosphorylation of BDNPP by PHA was also investigated, and it was observed that, when CTABr is added to PHA, the reaction is ca. 15-fold faster compared to the reaction when only PHA is present.},

abstract = {The effect of naphthols and methoxynaphthalenes on the microstructure transition of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) micelles is studied. Although the surface activities of these two types of organic dopants are strong, methoxynaphthalenes failed to promote spherical to worm-like micellar transition and to impart viscoelasticity to the aqueous CTAB solution, presumably due to their inability to form unique H-bonds with interfacial water. The micropolarity of OH sites of micelle-embedded naphthols is measured by observing the pK(a) shift at the micellar surface relative to bulk water. On the basis of spectroscopic and other data, the microstructures formed by both classes of dopants at the micellar surface are predicted. On the basis of hydroxyaromatic dopants, a simple and effective route to design pH-responsive viscoelastic worm-like micelles and the vesicles of single tail cationic surfactant (CTAB) is reported. Results are confirmed by observing cryogenic transmission electron microscopy (cryo-TEM) images.},

A progressive growth in micellar size was observed upon the addition of C12Enparticularly when n ≤ 5 and C12E3was found to be the most effective in promoting the micellar growth attributed to increasing hydrophobicity of surfactants. These results are well supported by SANS measurements which reveal increase in major axis of the ellipsoidal micelle with increase in C12E3concentration up to 20 mM, leading to large elongated micelles, above which the size remained nearly constant. Increased effectiveness of lipophilic nonionic surfactant is discussed in light of electrostatic and hydrophobic forces operating in solution, which are responsible for micellar growth process. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Vesicles are self-assembled nanocontainers that are used for the controlled release of cosmetics, drugs, and proteins. Researchers have been seeking to create photoresponsive vesicles that could enable the triggered release of encapsulated molecules with accurate spatial resolution. While several photoresponsive vesicle formulations have been reported, these systems are rather complex as they rely on special light-sensitive amphiphiles that require synthesis. In this study, we report a new class of photoresponsive vesicles based on two inexpensive and commercially available amphiphiles. Specifically, we employ p-octyloxydiphenyliodonium hexafluoroantimonate (ODPI), a cationic amphiphile that finds use as a photoinitiator, and a common anionic surfactant, sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate (SDBS). Mixtures of ODPI and SDBS form “catanionic” vesicles at certain molar ratios due to ionic interactions between the cationic and anionic headgroups. When irradiated with ultraviolet (UV) light, ODPI loses its charge and, in turn, the vesicles are converted into micelles due to the loss of ionic interactions. In addition, a mixture of these photoresponsive vesicles and a hydrophobically modified biopolymer gives a photoresponsive vesicle-gel. The vesicle-gel is formed because hydrophobes on the polymer insert into vesicle bilayers and thus induce a three-dimensional network of vesicles connected by polymer chains. Upon UV irradiation, the network is disrupted because of the conversion of vesicles to micelles, with the polymer hydrophobes getting sequestered within the micelles. As a result, the gel is converted to a sol, which manifests as a 40000-fold light-induced drop in sample viscosity.},

Hexagonal (H1), bicontinuous cubic (V1) with Ia3d symmetry, and polymer rich lamellar ( L$\alpha$′) are observed in the ternary diagram. C8F17EO10molecules are dissolved in polymer rich aggregates, whereas (C3F6O)nCOOH molecules are practically insoluble in the surfactant lamellar phase due to packing restrictions. Hence, two types of lamellar phases exist: one with surfactant rich ( L$\alpha$) and the other with polymer rich ( L$\alpha$′) in the water/C8F17EO10/(C3F6O)nCOOH system. As suggested by rheological measurements, worm-like micelles are present in C8F17EO10aqueous solutions but a rod-sphere transition takes place by solubilization of (C3F6O)nCOOH.

abstract = {We present an investigation on the effect of inter-micellar connections (branches) on the rheology of wormlike micelles. The system chosen is made of lecithin, minute amounts of water and organic solvents. Lecithin and water self-assemble into wormlike reverse micelles that can be branched or unbranched depending on the oil composition (and on the water content). In this respect, cyclohexane favours disconnected reverse micelles while isooctane promotes the formation of branches. By using mixtures of cyclohexane and isooctane as the oil phase and different water/lecithin ratios, the branch density of the system can be finely tuned. PGSE-NMR experiments allowed us to distinguish between branch-free (unbranched) and branched systems and the response of the very same samples to mechanical stress was measured by rheology. This allows, for the first time, an experimental correlation between rheological properties and the presence of branches. It turned out that the presence of a few inter-micellar connections sensibly decreases the zero-shear viscosity measured in steady state flow curves. Comparison with oscillatory rheology experiments indicates that the main effect of branches is to shorten the terminal relaxation time by speeding-up the reptation.},

abstract = {Copyright {\textcopyright} 2018 American Chemical Society. Phase behavior of surfactants in water may be affected by addition of a third component, and the present study discusses how long chain n-alcohols affect phase transitions of systems formed by alkyltrimethylammonium surfactants, C 16 TAB, or its complex salts formed with polyacrylate, C 16 TAPA 30 , as well as other previously reported complex salts/water/alcohol systems. X-ray diffraction at small and wide angles was used to characterize structures at different temperatures. Results from differential scanning calorimetry allowed us to study phase transitions and the coexistence of lamellar-gel (L $\beta$ ) and lamellar liquid-crystal (L $\alpha$ ) phases, elucidating the K structure previously observed by Fontell et al. [1]. Whereas the chain-melting transition is known to be sharp for lipids, we found it is broader for C 16 TAB and C 16 TAPA in the presence of n-alcohols. We investigated the effects of their composition and chain length on the temperature and enthalpy of transition. It elucidates why the addition of n-alcohols with chains shorter than the surfactants leads to the formation of L $\beta$ . n-Alcohols act as neutral cosurfactants leading to more packing and all the factors converge to a limit situation, which is a critical area occupied by each alkyl chain. We also demonstrated that the same trends of phase behavior occur for complex salts of other polyelectrolytes with alkyltrimethylammonium surfactants.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015 American Chemical Society. Although wormlike micelles (WLM) were first described more than 30 years ago, many aspects of their formation process are still unclear. Herein, a systematic experimental investigation of the process for wormlike micelle (WLM) formation in mixtures of tetradecyltrimethylammonium bromide (C {\textless} inf {\textgreater} 14 {\textless} /inf {\textgreater} TAB) and salicylate (2-hydroxybenzoate) was carried out. This system was used as a model to investigate the conditions for the formation of the giant aggregate. For comparison, the other two isomers of salicylate (3- and 4-hydroxybenzoate) were also investigated, once in these cases wormlike micelles are not formed. The studies were based on calorimetric titration, static light scattering, and rheological measurements. Enthalpy changes upon titration of C {\textless} inf {\textgreater} 14 {\textless} /inf {\textgreater} TAB into 2-hydroxybenzoate solutions revealed a highly cooperative and exothermic process that was associated with micelle growth. The size of the aggregates, obtained by static light scattering measurements, confirms the shape transition. In addition, the correlation of these two sets of results with measurements of micelle charge surface indicates that this transition occurs around the point of charge neutralization.},

abstract = {Surfactant aggregate microstructure changes induced by the addition of a series of phenolic organic dopants (phenol, cresol, 4-ethyl phenol and 4-n- and i-butyl phenol) to a micellar solution of cetyl trimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) have been studied using cryogenic transmission electron microscopy (cryo-TEM). As the concentration of each of the dopants is increased, there is a systematic reduction in the curvature of the observed microstructures. For phenol and cresol the microstructure changes from globular micelles to rod-like micelles and then to long worm-like micelles. For 4-ethyl phenol and 4-butyl phenol, the microstructure transforms from globular micelles to worm-like micelles to unilamellar vesicles and then bilamellar vesicles. The concentrations at which these morphological transitions take place reduce as the number of methyl substitutions on the phenolic ring is increased. These microstructure transitions are attributed to changes in the packing parameter of the surfactant complex as dopants penetrate to different degrees in the surfactant palisades layer, resulting from a balance of interaction between the surfactant tails and the dopant aromatic chain and the hydrogen bonding of the hydroxyl group with surrounding water. The alignment of the hydroxyl dipoles reduces the electrostatic field around the CTAB head groups, decreases interlayer repulsive interactions and allows membrane fluctuations to stabilize the bilamellar vesicles. These highly tunable microstructures can be exploited for templated materials synthesis, and have implications for the micellar-enhanced ultrafiltration process. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

As the temperature was raised dilute solutions of the copolymer in ethyl acetate showed a distinct cloud-point, which moved to higher temperatures with increases in concentration. On raising the temperature further the solutions gradually became clear again. Light scattering and electron microscopy studies showed that the onset of cloudiness was due to the formation of long worm-like micelles from spherical micelles. The clearing of solutions at higher temperatures occurred because the micelles dissociated to form copolymer molecules in the free-chain form. The cores of both types of micelle were composed of swollen polybutadiene blocks and the outer fringes of the micelles of polystyrene blocks. The spherical micelles had a fairly narrow size distribution. The worm-like micelles had a wide distribution of contour lengths but possessed a narrow size distribution in the radial direction, A second polystyrene-polybutadiene-polystyrene copolymer having shorter blocks than the first copolymer showed a similar type of solution behaviour at lower temperaturs.},

Vapor pressure osmometry showed that within the range of concentrations studied the average degree of polymerization is independent of the overall monomer concentration and roughly inversely proportional to the mole fraction of chain stoppers, in agreement with theoretical predictions. The correlation length as measured by static light scattering has a maximum at the overlap concentration in solutions without chain stoppers. In the presence of a fixed fraction of chain stoppers; the results coincide with those without chain stoppers at low and high concentrations, but there is a plateau in the correlation length at intermediate concentrations. From the data, information about the association constant and the persistence length of the chains is obtained. The effectiveness of the chain stopper is discussed, and the results from osmometry and static light scattering are compared. Dynamic light scattering was used to measure the time autocorrelation function. From the characteristic decay time, the hydrodynamic correlation length was calculated. For solutions above the overlap concentration, the distribution of decay times showed a second peak at longer times. It is not yet fully understood what the mechanism behind this slow mode is.},

abstract = {Experimental reports of surfactant systems displaying a second critical micelle concentration (second CMC) have been surveyed. It turns out that surfactant micelles usually show a growth behavior with some typical features. (i) Micelles grow weakly at low surfactant concentrations but may switch to a much stronger growth behavior at higher concentrations. The second CMC is defined as the point of transition from weakly to strongly growing micelles. (ii) Micelles are found to be non-spherically shaped below the second CMC. (iii) At the second CMC micelles are found to be much smaller, with aggregation numbers typically 100-200, than expected for flexible micelles. (iv) Micelles of intermediate size are present in a narrow concentration regime close to the second CMC. (v) Micelles grow much stronger above the second CMC than expected from a sphere-to-rod transition. The conventional spherocylindrical micelle model predicts a smooth growth behavior that contradicts the appearance of a second CMC. Modifying the model by means of including swollen end caps neither account for the presence of micelles with intermediate size, nor the strong growth behavior above the second CMC. Taking into account micelle flexibility is not consistent with the rather low micelle aggregation numbers observed at the second CMC. On the other hand, a recently proposed alternative theoretical approach, the general micelle model, have been demonstrated to take into account basically all features that are typical of experimentally observed micellar growth behaviors.},

abstract = {Laser diffraction has become a popular technique in many fields for measuring particle size distributions (PSDs). It is not only one of the standard techniques for laboratory measurements but is also gaining importance for on-line process monitoring and process control. This article reports some developments of this technique while recognizing the potential that still exists. In this report both particle size and shape are taken into account. For optimum results, both effective sensing and analysis of the diffraction pattern are required. This is the goal of our present study with a special interest in on-line application. In this paper, a statistical approach - principal component analysis (PCA) - to the scattered light signals from a conventional detector array is shown to improve the sensitivity to a few large particles relative to the main size distribution. For determining particle shape, a wedge-type photo-detector for sensing the azimuthal light intensity has been applied together with the procedures of cross-correlation, sweep selection for single particle presence and Fourier analysis. Finally, a novel light scattering sensor is presented, which enables the measurement of both size and shape and which offers even more promising applications for on-line process control.

abstract = {The application of nanotechnology in medicine, known as nanomedicine, has introduced a plethora of nanoparticles of variable chemistry and design considerations for cancer diagnosis and treatment. One of the most important field is the design and development of pharmaceutical drugs, based on targeted drug delivery system (TDDS). Being inspired by physio-chemical properties of nanoparticles, TDDS are designed to safely reach their targets and specifically release their cargo at the site of disease for enhanced therapeutic effects, thereby increasing the drug tissue bioavailability. Nanoparticles have the advantage of targeting cancer by simply being accumulated and entrapped in cancer cells. However, even after rapid growth of nanotechnology in nanomedicine, designing an effective targeted drug delivery system is still a challenging task. In this review, we reveal the recent advances in drug delivery approach with a particular focus on gold nanoparticles. We seek to expound on how these nanomaterials communicate in the complex environment to reach the target site, and how to design the effective TDDS for complex environments and simultaneously monitor the toxicity on the basis of designing such delivery complexes. Hence, this review will shed light on the research, opportunities and challenges for engineering nanomaterials with cancer biology and medicine to develop effective TDDS for treatment of cancer. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {The impact of NaCl and small hydrophobic molecules, used in perfumery, on the viscoelastic properties of aqueous solutions of sodium lauryl ether sulphate is studied. As the salt concentration increases, the viscosity passes through a maximum. Empirically, this behaviour is well known and is referred to as the 'salt curve'. Dynamic rheological measurements revealed a detailed picture of how salt affects the different length scales in the entangled wormlike micelles. Adding hydrophobic molecules does not change the shape of the salt curve, but they can shift the maximum to lower salt concentrations and alter the peak viscosity. The shift in the salt curve can generally be understood as due to either flattening of the interface, caused by insertion of amphiphilic molecules into the surfactant layer, or micellar swelling, caused by solubilization of very hydrophobic molecules in the micellar core. The viscosity decrease at the salt curve maximum is inversely proportional to the hydrophobicity of the added molecules, so less hydrophobic compounds cause larger decreases. It is hypothesized that these molecules interact with the surfactant headgroups and thereby soften the interfacial film. Our analysis suggests that the addition of hydrophobic additives reduces the persistence length and results in an effective shortening of the micelles. Introduction Giant wormlike micelles are elongated, semi-exible surfactant aggregates with remarkable rheological properties. Above a certain threshold concentration these surfactant solutions are viscoelastic due to the transient network formed by the entan-gled micelles. The viscoelasticity of giant micelles has been studied extensively, see for example ref. 1–5 and references therein. In contrast to polymers, wormlike micelles are dynamic systems that constantly break and recombine; therefore they are oen referred to as " living polymers " . 6,7 Understanding the viscoelasticity of wormlike micelles is very challenging as there are multiple pertinent length scales and stress relaxation mechanisms. Nevertheless, viscoelasticity gives a fascinating insight into the relationship between the molecular structure of such complex uids and their mechanical properties, and its understanding is important for the design and the development of industrial products containing giant wormlike micelles. These have many applications, including fracture uids in oil elds, drag reduction agents in hydrodynamic engineering and many home care, personal care and cosmetic products. 4,8 Here we have studied the effects of ionic strength and the addition of low concentrations of small hydrophobic molecules to aqueous solutions of the anionic surfactant sodium lauryl ether sulphate (SLES) (Scheme1). Entangled wormlike micelles of SLES have been shown to have viscoelastic properties. 9–11 It is one of the most widely used surfactants in consumer products for body care, such as shower gels, liquid hand soaps or shampoos. In the formulation of these products, salt (NaCl) is typically added to obtain a viscous gel. Increasing amounts of added salt signi-cantly affect the viscosity of the formulation, and the variation of the viscosity with the salt concentration is referred to as the 'salt curve'. 10–12 Typically, in the absence of salt the surfactant solutions are uid with viscosities close to that of water. The addition of a few weight percent of salt increases the zero-shear viscosity by several orders of magnitude up to a viscosity peak at a certain ionic strength. A further increase of salt decreases the viscosity. This variation is a convenient tool for formulators to ne tune the rheology of their products. Recently, Haward and McKinley demonstrated that the addition of salt can also have a dramatic effect on complex ows of surfactant solutions governed by viscoelasticity and shear thinning. 13 The molecular origin of these changes in viscosity is a constant transformation of the topology and the micellar shape as a function of ionic strength. The electrolyte screens the electrostatic repulsion between the charged headgroups of the surfactant, Scheme 1 Molecular structure of SLES. View Journal | View Issue decreasing the spontaneous curvature. 14,15 Typically, at a certain threshold concentration of salt, a transition from spherical to rodlike micelles occurs. Further addition of salt causes one-dimensional growth of the rods, resulting in the formation of giant, wormlike micelles that eventually overlap to form entangled networks. 16–19 At higher salt concentrations, the formation of three-way branches becomes energetically favourable. Branches were originally proposed by Porte et al. 20 Their existence was proved by cryo-TEM. 21,22 As Lequeux demonstrated, 23 branching causes a decrease in viscosity since branches allow micellar chains to slide along the micellar contour, thereby serving as stress relaxation points. Finally, at very high salt concentrations, the system phase separates into a concentrated, highly branched or liquid crystal phase and a dilute phase. The addition of small, hydrophobic molecules can also signicantly alter the rheological behaviour of surfactant systems. For example, adding perfume to a surfactant based formulation containing wormlike micelles, such as shower gels or shampoos, can lead to a thinning or a thickening of the base, to clouding or to phase separation, even at very low concentrations. A relationship between molecular struc-ture of perfume additives and micellar swelling in dilute surfac-tant systems has been obtained from studies with diffusion NMR spectroscopy. 24 Recently the formation of wormlike micelles in poly(oxyethylene) cholesteryl ether in aqueous solutions in the presence of lipophilic monoglycerides was shown to be induced by the addition of small amounts of aliphatic oils at low co-surfactant concentrations. 25 A dramatic inuence on the viscosity of wormlike micelles in aqueous solutions of CTAB was shown for trans-ortho-methoxycinnamic acid. 26 By irradiation with UV light the cis isomer was formed, which signicantly reduced the micellar length of the surfactant, thereby decreasing the zero-shear viscosity by four orders of magnitude. A particularly inter-esting observation has been reported by Munden in cosmetic formulations based on aqueous solutions of SLES. 12 The viscosity prole of the salt curve shied substantially in the presence of a hydrophobic additive, citronellol. With increasing concentrations of additive the viscosity peak shied to lower salt concentrations and the maximum steady shear viscosity was reduced. We study here the changes in the salt curve of SLES caused by the presence of small, hydrophobic molecules used as ingredients in perfumery. The focus is on linear viscoelasticity to provide an in-depth characterization of structural changes as a function of NaCl concentration and in the presence of the added molecules. Oscillatory rheology gives access to the various characteristic length scales and relaxation times that characterize the viscoelastic properties of these complex uids. We use the results to establish a relationship between the chemical nature of the hydrophobic additives and their effect on the macroscopic mechanical properties. Background},

For p-HB, it has been found that the aggregate is only formed by spherical micelles at all p-HB concentrations. On the other side, the situation is more complex for o-HB, where two distinct states of aggregation can be involved, depending on the concentration of o-HB. At high salt concentration, rodlike micelles are formed, whereas at lower concentration spherical aggregates are predominant. The transition from the cylinder to the sphere increases the mobility of the surfactant because the core of the rodlike micelles is more closely packed due to the expulsion of water from the interior of the aggregate. m-HB exhibits an intermediate behavior between these two extreme situations. The effect of the position of hydrophilic substituents on the aromatic ring on the insertion of the hydroxybenzoate anion in the micellar aggregate has been discussed.},

@article{Schramm1994,
abstract = {Some 15 years ago HAAKE published a booklet “Introduction to Practical Viscometry” which was translated into 7 languages and thus reached many readers worldwide. In the Seventies it was our intention to lecture on viscometry in as many countries as possible to make people aware of what non-Newtonian flow behavior meant and what the technical consequence of the shear rate dependency of many technically important fluids is. At that time in many technical branches such as in the paint industry,the “Ford-cup” was still considered a sufficient tool for foremen in factories to classify paint batches as “good” or “bad”. Orifice viscometers available under the names of Redwood, Sayboldt etc. were priced at some {\$}100 a piece. Rotational viscometers with a rotor speed programmer and a suitable x/t-recorder were sold at prices almost 100 times higher. It must have caused some amusement at management level when laboratories asked for such large amounts of money for a new rotational viscometer while the “cups” were cheap, unbreakable and had been sufficient for quality control for such a long time. HAAKE is proud for having contributed with its' rotational viscometers, worldwide seminars on viscometry and the above mentioned booklet to the understanding of viscometry as a small but important segment of physics. The growing interest in viscometry during the last decades has led to an astonishing increase in the numbers of viscometers sold, which in turn have found users worldwide both in scientific research and in industrial applications. The HAAKE management in the Seventies, of course, knew of the work of the famous Prof. Weissenberg, who already proved that most fluids in their response to shear stresses exhibited both viscous flow and elastic deformation as soon as the early Forties. Prof. Weissenberg also developed the “Rheogoniometer”, which for the first time enabled the measurement of both the corresponding shear stress signal defining viscosity and the normal force signal characterizing elasticity at a given shear rate. This first top-class rheometer was (by todays' standards) bulky and heavy and it was priced at a quarter of a million dollars, which limited it's sale to only a few outstanding research laboratories around the world. It has been said that in some 30 years only a few hundred of these instruments were actually made and this may have contributed to the fact that the manufacturer eventually dropped this product line. We at HAAKE in 1970 did not dare to offer such highly sophisticated rheometers, which were indeed better than Ford-cups but were priced some 2000-times higher. The last 15 years have seen great changes in the field of rheology and rheometry: Universities and technical colleges are now offering courses in rheometry and it's usage in scientific and technical applications in increasing numbers. Thou- Rheology sands of physicists, chemists and engineers have now understood that in rheology, viscosity and elasticity are linked to each other as closely as “men and women in the human race”: one should not regard one as more important than the other and certainly not completely ignore one factor in favour of the other! Machine tools have improved so much that for instance air bearings with machining tolerances of microns can be regarded as “normal” and strain sensors have been developed that divide a 360° revolution into 1000000 increments or even more. This has led to modern rheometers with a measuring sensitivity which allows an insight into rheological responses which people two decades ago could only have dreamt of. All this would still not have led to much if computerization had not become “everybody's tool” within the last ten years with computer prices dropping unbelievably and their capabilities increasing at the same time. We cannot promote dynamic tests in quality control departments unless a computer can handle phase shifts of sinusodial waves of strain inputs and resulting stress responses by means of a Fourier analysis. Equally, only computers can evaluate “creep and recovery tests” with regression calculations to differentiate between elasticity and viscosity responses as a function of shear history and recovery time. Data evaluation is carried out automatically in a minute or two by people whose mathematical training does not go much beyond simple calculus. 15 years have passed since the first edition of “Introduction to Practical Viscometry” appeared and it is time for a fully revised version including chapters which had then been omitted intentionally and those about which we could not have reported because test methods were not yet fully developed. There are very many good books and papers by famous rheologists such as Walters, Ferry, Cheng, Laun, Gleissle etc. which scientifically-minded readers should refer to. Their works are often quite large volumes which are sometimes difficult to read and comprehend for beginners to rheology. It is hoped that this book, in trying to give simple explanations for often complex phenomena and giving advice on “what to do and what not to do”, can induce readers to gain an insight into a field that is scientifically and technically fascinating and commercially rewarding.},

abstract = {The structural and energetic properties of solutions containing water, urea, and thmethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO) are examined using molecular dynamics simulations. Such systems are of interest mainly because TMAO acts to counter the protein denaturing effect of urea. Even at relatively high concentration, TMAO is found to fit well into the urea-water structure. The underlying solution structure is influenced by TMAO, but these perturbations tend to be modest. The TMAO-water and TMAO-urea interaction energies make an important contribution to the total energy in solutions where counter-denaturing effects are expected. TMAO-water and TMAO-urea hydrogen bonds have the largest hydrogen-bond energies in the system. Additionally, TMAO cannot hydrogen bond with itself, and hence it interacts strongly with water and urea. These observations suggest that the mechanism of TMAO counter denaturation is simply that water and urea prefer to solvate TMAO rather than the protein, hence inhibiting its unfolding. {\textcopyright} 2007 American Chemical Society.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: A high frequency of blue eyes and fair skin are reported in northern European Caucasians with type 1 diabetes (T1D). Also there is an inverse relationship between latitude and T1D incidence. We determined whether iris colour and skin pigmentation are risk factors in a Caucasian population living in two Mediterranean regions located at the same latitude with higher ultraviolet B irradiance, but with different T1D incidence. METHODS: We studied iris colour in 281 consecutive subjects with T1D and 298 controls. Skin type was evaluated by melanin quantification. RESULTS: In Lazio, blue eyes and fair skin type are significantly more common in T1D subjects than in controls (21 versus 9{\%}, p = 0.002; 50 versus 35{\%}, p {\textless} 0.001, respectively). In Sardinia, the frequency of blue eyes in T1D subjects is twice that in controls (5.8 versus 2.6{\%} and significantly higher when compared to the expected calculated frequency in the entire population). By logistic regression analysis, only blue eyes are independent and significant predictors of T1D [odds ratio for blue eyes = 2.2; 95{\%} confidence interval (1.1-4.4), p = 0.019]. CONCLUSIONS: As previously shown in a Caucasian population from northern Europe, blue eyes and a trend for fair skin increase the risk for T1D also in a Caucasian population born and residing in a Mediterranean region (Continental Italy). This finding may be relevant for explaining different T1D incidence as prevalence of blue eyes differ substantially between northern and southern European Caucasians.

abstract = {The preparation of polymeric particles and capsules by means of spontaneous droplet formation and subsequent polymer precipitation or synthesis is well-known. However, spontaneous emulsification is a phenomenon that has often been erroneously interpreted. This Minireview provides new insights into the preparation of metastable liquid dispersions by homogeneous liquid-liquid nucleation, and is based primarily on a recent study by Vitale and Katz (Langmuir, 2003, 19, 4105-4110). This spontaneous emulsification, which they named the Ouzo effect, occurs upon pouring, into water, a mixture of a totally water-miscible solvent and a hydrophobic oil--and optionally some water--thus generating long-lived small droplets, which are formed even though no surfactant is present. Herein, we review and reinterpret the most relevant publications on the synthesis of a variety of dispersions (pseudolatexes, silicone emulsions, biodegradable polymeric nanocapsules, etc.), which we believe have actually been synthesized using the Ouzo effect. The Ouzo effect may also become a substitute for high-shear techniques, which, to date have only been of limited utility on industrial scales.},

abstract = {In order to understand the non-Arrhenius structural relaxation in a systematic way, a measure of cooperativity is employed, which is based on the bond strength–coordination number fluctuation model developed by the authors. In our model, the cooperativity is described by the temperature-dependent number of structural units NBinvolved in the structural relaxation, which increases from unity at the high temperature limit up to of the order of 100 near the glass transition temperature Tg. This is comparable to that estimated by the Donth formula, but is much larger than that obtained from the Adam–Gibbs model. At higher temperature region a characteristic temperature Txis extracted from the cooperativity analysis, which could be associated with the transition temperature TAacross which the relaxation behavior changes from Arrhenius-like to non-Arrhenius-like. In the polymer melts and molecular liquids investigated, the characteristic temperature ratio Tx/Tgis found to be 1.67–1.81, which agrees with the typical TA/Tgvalues reported. The extracted temperature Txenables the characterization of the high-temperature relaxation behavior in a new way that differs from other methods. A possible interpretation of TAis given in terms of the cooperativity onset.},

abstract = {The probability distribution of amphiphile chain conformations in micelles of different geometries is derived through maximization of their packing entropy. A lattice model, first suggested by Dill and Flory, is used to represent the possible chain conformations in the micellar core. The polar heads of the chains are assumed to be anchored to the micellar surface, with the other chain segments occupying all lattice sites in the interior of the micelle. This “volume-filling” requirement, the connectivity of the chains, and the geometry of the micelle define constraints on the possible probability distributions of chain conformations. The actual distribution is derived by maximizing the chain's entropy subject to these constraints; “reversals” of the chains back towards the micellar surface are explicitly included. Results are presented for amphiphiles organized in planar bilayers and in cylindrical and spherical micelles of different sizes. It is found that, for all three geometries, the bond order parameters decrease as a function of the bond distance from the polar head, in accordance with recent experimental data. The entropy differences associated with geometrical changes are shown to be significant, suggesting thereby the need to include curvature (environmental)-dependent “tail” contributions in statistical thermodynamic treatments of micellization.},

abstract = {The study of intermicellar interaction is of a great deal of importance regarding its fundamental effect on micellar stability as a determining criterion which affects applied aspects of micellar aggregation especially drug delivery in biological systems. This review deals with the intermicellar interaction and stability of pure and binary mixed system of conventional and gemini surfactants. Since the colloidal stability is strictly dependent upon the micelle-micelle interaction, both electrostatic and van der Waals interactions have been taken into account and discussed according to DLVO theory. The effects of miscellaneous structural parameters such as head group, chain length, and counter ion on intermicellar interaction are studied which may affect the size and shape of micellar systems determining the surface charge density. Also, the medium effects including ionic strength, temperature, electrolyte conditions such as salts and ionic liquids on intermicellar interaction have been discussed. Additionally, the effects on non-DLVO forces such as hydration, hydrophobic, and steric interactions on micellar stability have been studied. The interaction between aggregates of binary mixed systems of cationic surfactants with Triton X-100 has been reported for the first time. The hydrodynamic radius (Rh0), aggregation number, and micellar diffusion coefficient have been calculated using the linear combination theory. The electrostatic and van der Waals attraction contributions have been also calculated and their magnitude was compared indicating that the van der Waals attractive contribution is often negligible compared to repulsive electrostatic interaction.},

abstract = {The hierarchical pathway from homogeneous solution to gel of a large-ring crown ether symmetrically substituted with four first-generation Percec-type dendrons (1) in n-dodecane has been followed by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), and fluorescence anisotropy methods. The 1/n-dodecane mixture requires a rather low gelation concentration of ?0.1{\%} (w/v) at room temperature. Mainly on the basis of in situ thermal SAXS measurements, we have found that upon cooling from the homogeneous solutions of 1/n-dodecane the 1 molecule first undergoes a solution self-assembly to form wormlike micelle with the core of crown ether and the shell of alkyl tails, which is ?living polymers? containing only one disklike molecule of 1 per cross-sectional repeating unit. The driving force of the assembly can be mainly attributed to the reduction of free energy during microphase separation among the different regions of molecules with distinct chemical properties and the lipophilic?lipophobic interaction in the solvent that is selective for the alkyl tails. Growth of the ?living polymer? proceeds continuously with lowering temperature and eventually brings the wormlike chains to entangle and to enter the miscibility gap of 1/n-dodecane. We propose that phase separation of the ?living polymer? solution is the main mechanism of the gelation, which gives a three-dimensional network of the slow-component of the ?living polymer?. The 1/n-dodecane gel is ?wet? with the solvent molecules participating in the ?polymer?-rich phase. The lyotropic orderings of rectangular and nematic-like packing of the wormlike micelles can be obtained using slow and fast cooling protocol, respectively, which are very different from the hexagonal columnar phase found in the bulk and xerogel samples. We have also tested whether the channel formed by dibenzo-30-crown-10 moiety at the cylindrical micelle center of 1 can accommodate guest molecules. Using rhodamine B as an example, we have demonstrated that 1 can solubilize the cationic dye in n-dodecane at high temperature. After the micellization and gelation, the rhodamine B molecules are successfully introduced into the crown ether cavities.},

Wormlike micelles are observed at a dopant-to-CTAB molar ratio of 1:3. At higher dopant ratios (1:1), globular vesicles are observed which transition to tubular vesicles when the dopant becomes the predominant species at a ratio of 3:1. These transitions are reflected in small-angle neutron scattering analysis and, interestingly, can be directly observed through cryo-transmission electron microscopy. The para-substituted phenol is interfacially active and modulates interfacial curvature of the micelles. The observations of microstructure modifications have relevance to the synthesis of mesoporous materials using CTAB as the template.},

Viscosity data for aqueous gl{\textgreater}cerol solutions in the range of 0" to 100" C. and 0 to 100{\%} concentration have been reported by various authors, each working within limited temperature or concentration ranges. Different types of viscometers were used. As a result there are gaps and inconsistencies in the data. The viscosit? data reported here were obtained with a single type of viscometer over the entire range of 0" to 100' C. and 0 to 100{\%} glycerol concentration. The data will be useful in the design and use of glycerol-handling equipment. They also make it possible to use aqueous glycerol solutions as viscosity standards over a wide range of viscosity and at temperatures from 0' to loo" a=. 'SERE have been several studies of glycerol viscosity for limited ranges of conceriti ations and temperatures. How-ever, there has been no extensive study of aqueous glycerol solu-tions over 0" to 100" C. temperature range using a single type of viscometer. Herz and Wegner (12) measured the viscosity of glycerol solutions of 10 to 92{\%} concentration a t temperatures From 10' to 80' C. Their results were published in terms of both relative and absolute viscosity. Archbutt and Deelev (2) made careful viscosity measurements of glycerol solutions a t 20' C. The capillary of their viscometer had a diameter of 0.6180 mm. and a length of 21.991 cm., with square ends. The hydrostatic head was increased by a supplementary tube attached to the capillary when the more viscous solutions were used. Darke and Lewis (10) measured the relative viscosity of glyceiol solutions of 10 to 92{\%} concentration a t 1' C . They did not record the specific gravities of their solutions, nor did they state how the viscosity measurements were made. They published their data together with the relative viscosity data of Herz and Wegner to make a comprehensive tabulation. Cocks (9) combined other published data with those published by Darke and Lewis and addrd some original data obtained with a standard Redwood vis-cometer to make a compilation covering most of the points from 1' to 100" C., and from 0 to 99{\%} of glycerol. The data are given in terms of poises. There are a number of inconsistencies in the at)ove data, particularly in the regwn of tempcratureq ahovc 70" C. Sheely (16), using a viscometer of the type described by Bingham and Jackson (4), in which pressure on the liquid was controlled by a regulated air supply, made very careful measure-ments of the viscosity of glycerol solutions of 0 to 100{\%} concen-trations and a t the temperatures of 20", 22.5", 25", 27.5", and 30" C. Mtiller (I C) published viscosity values for water and five concentrations of glycerol at temperatures from 17" to 90" C. Vand (Ill), using Ostwald viscometers, determined the viscosity of glycerol solutions of 98.4 and 99.6{\%} concentrations a t ten temperatures from 80" to 167" 6. Green and Parke (11) meas-ured the viscosities of glycerol solutions at temperatures from 0" to -40" C., within the limits of the freezing points of the solutions. Tammann and Hesse (17) measured the viscosity of 99.5{\%} glycerol a t temperatures from -42' to -4.2" C. The viscosity of pure glycerol a t pressures up to 12,000 kg. per sq. cm., a t 30' C., was measured by Bridgman (6). The present work was done to correct some inaccuracies in the previous data, to provide data where none were available, and to provide a series of consistent viscosity data all obtained with the same type of viscometer, within the limits of 0" to 100" C., and 0 to 100{\%} glycerol concentration.

Rather small prolate ellipsoidal micelles form in the absence of added salt and at [NaCl] = 10 mM in D(2)O. The micelles grow considerably in length to large rods as the electrolyte concentration is raised to [NaCl] = 0.1 M. In excess of nonionic surfactant ([SDS]/[C(10)G] = 1:3) at [NaCl] = 0.1 M in D(2)O, several thousands of Angstroms long wormlike micelles are observed. Most interestingly, a conspicuously large isotope solvent effect was observed from static light scattering data according to which micelles formed at [SDS]/[C(10)G] = 1:3 and [NaCl] = 0.1 M in H(2)O are at least five times smaller than micelles formed in the corresponding samples in D(2)O.},

abstract = {A new cationic/anionic surfactant system is studied that consists of the zwitterionic alkyldimethylamine oxide (C(14)DMAO) and the anionic dihydroperfluorooctanoic acid (C6F13CH2COOH, DHPFOA, pK(a) = 3.35). In the investigated system, the cationic surfactant is produced by the protonation of the amineoxide by the perfluorooctanoic acid. As a result of this proton-transfer reaction, the mixed system does not contain excess salt as do other studied cationic/anionic surfactant systems. Otherwise, the studied system shows the typical phase behavior of catanionic surfactant systems. With increasing concentrations of DHPFOA, for 100 mM C(14)DMAO solutions one observes a L-1-phase, a viscous L-1-phase, a two-phase L-1/L-alpha-region where a birefringent L-alpha-phase is at the bottom of the L-1-phase, a single birefringent and slightly viscoelastic L-alpha-phase, and finally (greater than or equal to 72 mM DHPFOA) two separate phases (L-1/L-C) where the bottom phase consists of crystals of DHPFOA. The phases of the system have been characterized by theological and conductivity measurements. The birefringent L-alpha-phase has been investigated by means of freeze-fracture transmission electron microscopy. The birefringent L-alpha-phase is composed of novel unilamellar and multilamellar vesicles and large vesicles that have small unilamellar vesicles enclosed. L-alpha-phases with excess salt were produced by two different preparation routes. When the components are mixed directly, which involves shear forces, we obtained a vesicle phase. When, in contrast, the L-alpha-phase is produced without shear by hydrolysis of methylformate that forms hydrogen ions in a L-1-phase consisting of C(14)DMAO and potassium hydroperfluorooctanoate (C6F13CH2COOK), the resulting L-alpha-phase is a classic L-1-phase with stacked bilayers. This phase can easily be transformed into vesicles by shearing forces, for instance, by turning the samples upside down a few times. We thus demonstrate that the vesicles that are obtained by mixing of the compounds are not formed spontaneously but are the result of shear forces in the mixing process. The kinetically produced L-alpha-phase contains potassium formate in excess, and it could be argued that the different structures in the two phases could be the result of the excess salt. In the one phase, it is shown that this is not the case. When the L-1-phase from the alkyldimethylamine oxide and the potassium perfluorooctanoate is mixed (sheared) with formic acid directly, one obtains again a viscoelastic L-alpha-phase with vesicles. It is thus shown that L-alpha-phases can exist and form in two different states: in the classic state with stacked bilayers and in the vesicle state. Both states are stable for long times. It is believed that the classic state is the one which is in thermodynamic equilibrium. The vesicle state has different macroscopic properties than the classic stacked bilayer state. It is viscoelastic and can be optically isotropic.},

abstract = {We report a new route for forming reverse wormlike micelles (i.e., long, flexible micellar chains) in nonpolar organic liquids such as cyclohexane and n-decane. This route involves the addition of a bile salt (e.g., sodium deoxycholate) in trace amounts to solutions of the phospholipid lecithin. Previous recipes for reverse wormlike micelles have usually required the addition of water to induce reverse micellar growth; here, we show that bile salts, due to their unique " facially amphiphilic " structure, can play a role analogous to that of water and promote the longitudinal aggregation of lecithin molecules into reverse micellar chains. The formation of transient entangled networks of these reverse micelles transforms low-viscosity lecithin organosols into strongly viscoelastic fluids. The zero-shear viscosity increases by more than 5 orders of magnitude, and it is the molar ratio of bile salt to lecithin that controls the viscosity enhancement. The growth of reverse wormlike micelles is also confirmed by small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) experiments on these fluids.},

abstract = {The quality of protein structures determined by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is contingent on the number and quality of experimentally-derived resonance assignments, distance and angular restraints. Two key features of protein NMR data have posed challenges for the routine and automated structure determination of small to medium sized proteins; (1) spectral resolution - especially of crowded nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy (NOESY) spectra, and (2) the reliance on a continuous network of weak scalar couplings as part of most common assignment protocols. In order to facilitate NMR structure determination, we developed a semi-automated strategy that utilizes non-uniform sampling (NUS) and multidimensional decomposition (MDD) for optimal data collection and processing of selected, high resolution multidimensional NMR experiments, combined it with an ABACUS protocol for sequential and side chain resonance assignments, and streamlined this procedure to execute structure and refinement calculations in CYANA and CNS, respectively. Two graphical user interfaces (GUIs) were developed to facilitate efficient analysis and compilation of the data and to guide automated structure determination. This integrated method was implemented and refined on over 30 high quality structures of proteins ranging from 5.5 to 16.5 kDa in size.},

abstract = {We present a molecular-level theory for amphiphile packing in linear micelles, focusing on the early stages of micellar elongation, i.e., on small and "intermediate-size" micelles, whose endcaps are not yet molded into a final shape. The internal free energy of a micelle of given size and shape is expressed as an integral over local molecular packing free energies in different regions of the micelle. The free energy per molecule is expressed as a sum of interfacial ("opposing forces") and chain conformational contributions, both depending on the local geometry. The equilibrium shape and energy of the micelle is determined by functional minimization of the total free energy. For amphiphiles exhibiting strong preference for packing in the cylindrical geometry, we show that the early stages of growth involve an energetic barrier, resulting in a "gap" in the micellar size distribution. That is, at low total amphiphile concentrations only small (globular) micelles appear in solution. Their concentration reaches a well-defined saturation value, beyond which, all added amphiphiles are incorporated in long micelles, whose "non-interacting" endcaps are well separated by the cylindrical middle part. This, "second CMC" behavior is demonstrated by numerical calculations of micellar size distributions and average aggregation numbers as a function of the total concentration. The conditions necessary for the appearance of a second CMC are analyzed theoretically, with explicit reference to the underlying molecular packing characteristics. In particular, it is shown that a necessary condition for the appearance of a sharply defined second CMC is that the endcap energies (of at least some) of the small or intermediate-size micelles must be considerably lower than the asymptotic (long micelle) value of this quantity. The diameter of the minimal, spherical micelles, as well as that of the final endcaps, is found to be larger than the diameter of the cylindrical body of the very long micelles. Our results are in good qualitative agreement with recent cryo-TEM imaging studies of micellar shape and growth, as well as with previous (less direct) experiments revealing second CMC behavior.},

abstract = {In this work, we present ab initio derived intermolecular potentials for the urea-water system. Our method of calculation, which is termed NEMO, is based on intermolecular perturbation theory. Dipole moment fluctuations as well as many-body effects in an assembly of molecules are described by including atomic polarizabilities in the potential. For the urea dimer we found a cyclic minimum with an energy of -21.9 kcal/mol and two equivalent hydrogen bonds of length 1.77 Angstrom. Noteworthy is that this interaction energy is more than four times larger than the water dimer minimum energy. To be able to satisfactorily model the interaction between two urea molecules we have improved the NEMO approach in the description of the repulsion energy and we have also included a more accurate damping on the dispersion energy. With this improved model we reinvestigated the water dimer and urea-water potentials and found good agreement with earlier potentials derived with similar approaches. From simulations of liquid water we investigated the sensitivity of structural properties resulting from small changes in repulsion parameters. Qualitative changes of the tetrahedral hydrogen bonding may occur for inappropriate parameter choices of the same potential surface.},

The structures and modes of formation of the self-assembled fibrillar networks (SAFINs) that immobilize the liquid components of the gels are discussed experimentally and theoretically. The spectroscopic, rheological, and structural features of the different classes of low molecular-mass gelators are also presented. Many examples of the application of the principal analytical techniques for investigation of molecular gels (including SANS, SAXS, WAXS, UV-vis absorption, fluorescence and CD spectroscopies, scanning electron, transmission electron and optical microscopies, and molecular modeling) are presented didactically and in-depth, as are several of the theories of the stages of aggregation of individual low molecular-mass gelator molecules leading to SAFINs. Several actual and potential applications of molecular gels in disparate fields (from silicate replication of nanostructures to art conservation) are described. Special emphasis is placed on perspectives for future developments.This book is an invaluable resource for researchers and practitioners either already researching self-assembly and soft matter or new to the area. Those who will find the book useful include chemists, engineers, spectroscopists, physicists, biologists, theoreticians, and materials scientists.},

abstract = {The rheological and mass transport properties of phenol in micellar solutions of hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) were studied by rheometry and spectrophotometry. The presence of phenol located between headgroups of the CTAB diminishes the repulsive forces between the cationic groups and induces a sharp increase in viscosity that is attributed to the one-dimensional micellar growth favoring the formation of worm-like micelles. It is found that the mass transfer of phenol between two immiscible phases is significantly retarded by the presence of CTAB. The transfer is particularly slow when the diffusion takes place from a surfactant solution phase to an organic phase. This behavior is attributed to the phenol surfactant interaction that leads to micellar growth and viscoelastic behavior. However, at elevated temperature, viscosity decreases and mass transfer increases. This particular rheological behavior offers the possibility of regulating the mass transfer, which might be interesting for applications.},

The relaxation data, supported by cryogenic transmission electron microscopy that excludes oblate micelle shapes, suggest that the C16TABr micelles, slightly elongated even without benzene, become longer and more polydisperse on benzene addition. Field-dependent 2H spin relaxation measurements on the benzene (C6D6) indicate that at low solubilizate content the benzene is predominantly located at the micellar interface, reorients more slowly than in bulk, and has a high lateral diffusion coefficient. Above a particular benzene concentration, the surfactant relaxation data suggest no further elongation but a radial growth, while the benzene relaxation shows that a large part of the benzene is residing in an interior region with near-bulk characteristics; the micelles become slightly elongated microemulsion droplets.},

The junction of three cylindrical aggregates is represented by a combination of pieces of the torus and bilayer. A geometry-dependent analytical solution is obtained for the linearized Poisson-Boltzmann equation. This analytical solution is applicable to saddle-like structures and reduces to the solutions known previously for planar, cylindrical, and spherical aggregates. For micellar junctions, our new analytical solution is in excellent agreement with numerical results over the range of parameters typical of ionic surfactant systems with branching micelles. Our model correctly predicts the sequence of stable aggregate morphologies, including a narrow bicontinuous zone, in dependence of hydrocarbon tail length, head size, and solution salinity. For predicting properties of a spatial network of wormlike micelles, our aggregation free energy is used in the Zilman-Safran theory. Our predictions are compared with experimental data for branching micelles of ionic surfactants.},

@article{Rusanov2014,
abstract = {Among numerous definitions of the critical micelle concentration (CMC), there is one related to the constant K of the mass action law as CMC = K1?n (n is the aggregation number). In this paper, the generalization of this definition for multicomponent micelles and the development of the mass-action-law theory of micellization based on this definition and the analysis of a multiple-equilibrium polydisperse micellar system have been presented. This variant of the theory of micellization looks more consistent than the earlier one. In addition, two thermodynamic findings are reported: the stability conditions for micellar systems and the dependence of aggregation numbers on the surfactant concentrations. The growth of the monomer concentration with the total surfactant concentration is shown to be a thermodynamic rule only in the case of a single sort of aggregative particles or at adding a single surfactant to a mixture. The stability condition takes more complex form when adding a mixture of aggregative particles. For the aggregation number of a micelle, it has been deduced a thermodynamic rule obeying it to increase with the total surfactant concentration. However, if the monomer concentration increases slowly, the aggregation number increases much more slowly and the more slowly the more pronounced is a maximum corresponding to a micelle on the distribution hypersurface (curve in the one-component case). This forms grounding for the quasi-chemical approximation in the mass-action-law theory (the constancy of aggregation numbers).},

It is found that the CTAB-NMEA-12 or CTAB-NMEA-16 and DTAB-NMEA-16 surfactant systems show viscoelastic behavior typical of systems containing wormlike micelles. The dynamic viscoelastic behavior of the viscoelastic micellar phase follows the Maxwell model at low shear frequency at the composition of maximum viscosity. The mixing fraction of NMEA in total amphiphile for the maximum viscosity increases with decreasing the total amphiphile concentration. Most probably, in a dilute region, as, the effective cross-sectional area per surfactant at the hydrophobic interface in the micelle, increases and more NMEA is needed to decrease the average as. Assuming that one-dimensional growth of micelles takes place upon addition of NMEA and as for the surfactant and NMEA are constant, the rod-micellar length was calculated as a function of the mixing fraction of NMEA in total amphiphile. As a result, the rodlike micellar length is not largely increased up to certain amount of added NMEA, above which the enormous increase in micellar length takes place. The micellar growth can be simply explained by decreasing the effective cross-sectional area per amphiphile upon addition of NMEA.},

abstract = {The three-dimensional solution structure of the complex between calcium-bound calmodulin (Ca(2+)-CaM) and a 26-residue synthetic peptide comprising the CaM binding domain (residues 577 to 602) of skeletal muscle myosin light chain kinase, has been determined using multidimensional heteronuclear filtered and separated nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The two domains of CaM (residues 6 to 73 and 83 to 146) remain essentially unchanged upon complexation. The long central helix (residues 65 to 93), however, which connects the two domains in the crystal structure of Ca(2+)-CaM, is disrupted into two helices connected by a long flexible loop (residues 74 to 82), thereby enabling the two domains to clamp residues 3 to 21 of the bound peptide, which adopt a helical conformation. The overall structure of the complex is globular, approximating an ellipsoid of dimensions 47 by 32 by 30 angstroms. The helical peptide is located in a hydrophobic channel that passes through the center of the ellipsoid at an angle of approximately 45 degrees with its long axis. The complex is mainly stabilized by hydrophobic interactions which, from the CaM side, involve an unusually large number of methionines. Key residues of the peptide are Trp4 and Phe17, which serve to anchor the amino- and carboxyl-terminal halves of the peptide to the carboxyl- and amino-terminal domains of CaM, respectively. Sequence comparisons indicate that a number of peptides that bind CaM with high affinity share this common feature containing either aromatic residues or long-chain hydrophobic ones separated by a stretch of 12 residues, suggesting that they interact with CaM in a similar manner.},

Such specification provides little intuition about how the stimuli will appear. For applications such as color selection, color is specified using appearance terms and an automatic method for computing the corresponding tristimulus coordinates. To do so, one needs to understand the relation between the physical description of a color stimulus and a quantitative description of its color appearance. Another aspect of practical importance is to specify the magnitude of differences between colored stimuli. This requires the understanding of the relation between changes in the physical description of a color stimulus and corresponding changes in appearance. This chapter provides an introduction to color specification systems and describes their use. The chapter also discusses the phenomenology of color appearance and describes the psychological attributes of hue, saturation/ chroma, and brightness/lightness.},

abstract = {A major scientific challenge of the past decade pertaining to the field of soft matter has been to craft 'adaptable' materials, inspired by nature, which can dynamically alter their structure and functionality on demand, in response to triggers produced by environmental changes. Amongst these, 'smart' surfactant wormlike micelles, responsive to external stimuli, are a particularly recent area of development, yet highly promising, given the versatility of the materials but simplicity of the design-relying on small amphiphilic molecules and their spontaneous self-assembly. The switching 'on' and 'off' of the micellar assembly structures has been reported using electrical, optical, thermal or pH triggers and is now envisaged for multiple stimuli. The structural changes, in turn, can induce major variations in the macroscopic characteristics, affecting properties such as viscosity and elasticity and sometimes even leading to a spontaneous and effective 'sol-gel' transition. These original smart materials based on wormlike micelles have been successfully used in the oil industry, and offer a significant potential in a wide range of other technological applications, including biomedicine, cleaning processes, drag reduction, template synthesis, to name but a few. This review will report results in this field published over the last few years, describe the potential and practical applications of stimuli-responsive wormlike micelles and point out future challenges.},

abstract = {A comparative study about the efficiency of five commercial products used to facilitate the transport of oil through pipelines was developed using a new experimental technique. The technique is based on the applied torque necessary to keep the samples rotating in turbulent flow. The hydrodynamic drag reduction is proportional to the difference on the torque applied in oil samples with and without the additive. The experiments were developed in a Couette cell of a rheometer, which is sensitive to determine levels of drag reduction with high accuracy. The method was tested by using five commercial samples of drag reducers added to a Brazilian oil sample. Their efficiency, as well as their optimum concentrations, was compared. The method has proven very attractive mainly due to the low amount of sample and the short time required for the measurements.},

abstract = {Cryo-transmission electron microscopy (cryo-TEM) is a powerful method for uncovering the structure of soft nanostructured materials. The method is based on ultra-fast cooling and conversion of a liquid sample to a vitrified (glassy) specimen that can be examined in the TEM. Direct-imaging cryo-TEM discloses both the global supramolecular structure and local aggregate-specific details, at the hydrated state, and at a nanometer resolution. This placed the method as a central characterization tool in colloid, material, bio- and nano-related technologies in academia and industry. The advancement of cryo-TEM to new fields of research has been motivated also by significant improvements in instrumentation and software. In this review, we summarize the primary principles of cryo-TEM and highlight the recent contribution of this method to understanding soft-matter self-assembly. Detailed example address the origin of the viscosity peak in micellar solutions, and the nature of exotic assemblies as branched micelles, and micellar discs and ribbons. We further emphasize the strategic application of direct-imaging cryo-TEM to study fundamental biological processes and structure-function relations using the example of membrane-remodeling proteins involved in fission and fusion. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The sugar alcohol glycerol is essential for cryopreservation, an important process used for the storage of biological molecules, cells, or tissues at low temperatures. A key hypothesis for the cryoprotective action of glycerol is that the glycerol molecule acts to modify the hydrogen bonding ability of water molecules, thus inhibiting ice formation. In this study, high-resolution neutron diffraction has been used in conjunction with hydrogen/deuterium isotopic labeling to determine with unprecedented detail the structure of a dilute aqueous glycerol solution. Contrary to some expectations, at the first neighbor level no modification in the position of the coordination shell of water is observed. However, at the second neighbor level the presence of only small quantities of glycerol in the solution has the same impact on water structure as increasing the pressure. Evidence is also found of more glycerol monomers than would be expected in the solution. This prevalence of isolated glycerol molecules results in a very well mixed solution with glycerol-water hydrogen bond interactions being very favorable. Our results indicate that while the local structure of water is relatively unperturbed by the presence of glycerol, the hydrogen bonded network is highly mixed between glycerol and water. These results indicate that efforts to explain the action of glycerol should focus on not just local water structure, but the extended hydrogen bonded network in the system.},

@article{Rakitin2005a,
abstract = {It is well-known that some aromatic anions have the ability to induce viscoelastic transformation in aqueous solutions of cationic surfactants even at added salt concentrations as low as 10-20 mM. This behavior is associated with the formation of an entangled network of elongated micelles. However, the effect of aromatic ring substituents on the anion's ability to promote rapid micelle growth is not well-understood. We have performed ab initio calculations of the carbonyl group rotation barriers in a series of substituted benzoate and naphthoate anions at the MP2/STO-3G level of theory. It was found that aromatic carboxylates, known to be particularly effective in causing sphere-rod transition in cationic micelles, preferably adopt conformations with the COO(-) group in the same plane as the ring(s). This structural preference can be attributed to either intramolecular hydrogen bonding (o-hydroxyl derivatives) or pi-conjugation effects (m- and p-halogenated derivatives). In the former case the barrier to rotation is 40-50 kcal/mol, whereas in the latter case the threshold value is around 3.0 kcal/mol. Propensity for the planar conformation correlates with a greater depth of counterion penetration into the micelle surface, as inferred from NMR experiments, compared to the anions with less hindered carbonyl rotation. This points to favorable hydrophobic interactions between the surfactant methylene groups and the aromatic ring(s) of the anion as a possible explanation for the rapid growth of cationic micelles observed upon addition of certain aromatic carboxylates.},

The results provide additional evidence for the previously noted analogy of behavior between concentrated solutions of very elongated micelles and solutions of polymer chains in the semidilute range where the chains are entangled. The results confirm that the micelles keep growing when the surfactant concentration exceeds the cross-over concentration where the micellar domains overlap. The power laws governing the rheological behavior of semidilute polymer solutions all apply to the micellar systems investigated when the micelles are sufficiently elongated. This appears to be the case for CTAB solutions at concentrations above 0.3 M, in the presence of 0.1 M KBr or more, and temperatures below about 35°C. {\textcopyright} 1988.},

abstract = {The complex aggregation processes of dodecyltrimethylammonium chloride (DTAC) have been studied in dilute solutions of sodium salicylate (NaSal) by isothermal titration calorimetry and electrical conductivity at temperatures between 278.15 K and 318.15 K. A structural transformation that was dependent on the concentrations of DTAC and NaSal was observed. The micellization process in dilute solutions of DTAC has been subjected to a detailed thermodynamic analysis and shown to occur at considerably lower critical micelle concentrations than reported for DTAC in water and NaCl solutions. Gibbs free energy, $\Delta$ mic G o, and entropy, $\Delta$ mic S o, were deduced by taking into account the degree of micelle ionization, $\beta$, estimated from conductivity measurements. From the temperature dependence of the enthalpy of micellization, $\Delta$ mic H o, the heat capacities of micellization, $\Delta$micc o p were determined and discussed in terms of the removal of large areas of non-polar surface from contact with water upon micellization. The process is exothermic at all temperatures, indicating, in addition to the hydrophobic effect, the presence of strong interactions between surfactant and salicylate ions. These were confirmed by 1H NMR spectroscopy and diffusion NMR experiments. Salicylate ions not only interact with the headgroups but also insert further into the micelle core. At c NaSal/c DTAC {\textgreater} 2.5, the structural rearrangements occur even at relatively low concentrations of NaSal.},

abstract = {Dry reverse micelles of the anionic twin-tailed surfactant bis(2-ethylhexyl) sulfosuccinate (AOT) dissolved in nonpolar solvents spontaneously form an organogel when p-chlorophenol is added in a 1:1 AOT:phenol molar ratio. The solvents used were benzene, toluene, m-xylene, 2,2,4-trimethylpentane (isooctane), decane, dodecane, tetradecane, hexadecane, and 2,6,10,14-tetramethylpentadecane (TMPD). The proposed microstructure of the gel is based on strands of stacked phenols linked to AOT through hydrogen bonding. Small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) spectra of the organogels suggest a characteristic length scale for these phenol-AOT strands that is independent of concentration but dependent on the chemical nature of the nonpolar solvent used. Correlation lengths determined from the SAXS spectra indicate that the strands self-assemble into fibers. Direct visualization of the gel in its native state is accomplished by using tapping mode atomic force microscopy (AFM). It is shown that these organogels consist of fiber bundle assemblies. The SAXS and AFM data reinforce the theory of a molecular architecture consisting of three length scales-AOT/phenolic strands (ca. 2 nm in diameter) that self-assemble into fibers (ca. 10 nm in diameter), which then aggregate into fiber bundles (ca. 20-100 nm in diameter) and form the organogel.},

abstract = {Understanding and engineering the flow-response of complex and non-Newtonian fluids at a molecular level is a key challenge for their practical utilisation. Here we demonstrate the coupling of microfluidics with small angle neutron scattering (SANS). Microdevices with high neutron transmission (up to 98{\%}), low scattering background (≲10⁻² cm⁻¹), broad solvent compatibility and high pressure tolerance (≈3-15 bar) are rapidly prototyped via frontal photo polymerisation. Scattering from single microchannels of widths down to 60 $\mu$m, with beam footprint of 500 $\mu$m diameter, was successfully obtained in the scattering vector range 0.01-0.3 {\AA}(-1), corresponding to real space dimensions of ≃10-600 {\AA}. We demonstrate our approach by investigating the molecular re-orientation and alignment underpinning the flow response of two model complex fluids, namely cetyl trimethylammonium chloride/pentanol/D₂O and sodium lauryl sulfate/octanol/brine lamellar systems. Finally, we assess the applicability and outlook of microfluidic-SANS for high-throughput and flow processing studies, with emphasis of soft matter.},

abstract = {Wormlike micelles, obtained firstly in anionic surfactant sodium dodecyl trioxyethylene sulfate (SDES) solutions in the presence of AlCl3, were studied using zero-shear viscosities and freeze-fracture TEM micrographs. Then the effects of inorganic salts with different cations, AlCl3, MgCl2, CaCl2, and NaCl, on the rheological properties and microstructures of the SDES micellar solutions were investigated generally. The steady-shear viscosity followed the Cross empirical equation, and the dynamic v1scoelasticity was well modeled by the simple Maxwell model. There exists an optimal molar ratio R. of surfactant to salt at which the micelles reach maximum growth. We find R-m less than or equal to 1/5 for SDES/NaCl system, and R-m approximate to 1/3 for the other three systems. Variations in the surfactant packing parameter R-p help explain the changes of rheology and microstructure of the solutions, according to the cationic radii and charges and the interaction between the cations and surfactant molecular headgroups. The ability of cations that make the micelles reach a maximum growth followed the order of Al3+ {\textgreater} Mg2+ {\textgreater} Ca2+ {\textgreater} Na+. [References: 40]},

abstract = {Molecular areas of soluble films at the air/water interface have traditionally been calculated by applying the Gibbs equation to the steep linear decline in surface tension as the bulk concentration increases. This approach presupposes that the interface is saturated in the "Gibbs region," thereby allowing a single unique area to be calculated. We show that the areas derived by the Gibbs equation (typically 50-60 A(2)/molecule) are much too large to account for the abrupt surface tension decline. Moreover, a surface tension/concentration plot was observed for a system where micelle formation does not interfere with the Gibbs region. Nonetheless, the surface tension plot leveled off, ostensibly owing to saturation, when the Gibbs approach predicted a continued linear decline, proving that the interface in the Gibbs region is not saturated as generally assumed. This conclusion means that the hundreds of published molecular areas obtained by the Gibbs approach should be reconsidered.},

Here we show that modern ITC apparatus and new processing methods allow researchers to obtain a complete kinetic description of systems more diverse than previously thought, ranging from simple ligand binding to complex RNA folding. We illustrate these new features with a simple case (HIV-1 reverse transcriptase/inhibitor interaction) and with the more complex case of the folding of a riboswitch triggered by the binding of its ligand. The originality of the new kinITC method lies in its ability to dissect, both thermodynamically and kinetically, the two components: primary ligand binding and subsequent RNA folding. We are not aware of another single method that can yield, in a simple way, such deep insight into a composite process. Our study also rationalizes common observations from daily ITC use.},

abstract = {An expression for the elastic free-energy density of a wormlike micelle is derived taking into account interactions between its constituent molecules. The resulting expression is quadratic in the curvature and torsion of the centerline of micelle and thus resembles free-energy density functions for polymer chains and helical filaments such as DNA. The model is applied on a wormlike micelle in the shape of a circular arc, open or closed. Conditions under which linear chains in dilute systems transform into toroidal rings are analyzed. Two concrete anisotropic soft-core interaction potentials are used to calculate the elastic moduli present in the derived model, in terms of the density of the molecules and their dimensions. Expressions for the persistence length of the wormlike micelle are found based on the flexural rigidities so obtained. Similar to previous observations, our results indicate that the persistence length of a wormlike micelle increases as the aspect ratio of its constituent molecules increases. A detailed application of the model on wormlike micelles of toroidal geometry, along with employing statistical-thermodynamical concepts of self-assembly is performed, and the results are found to be well consistent with the literature. Steps to obtain the material parameters through possible experiments are discussed},

abstract = {The thioredoxin reductase/thioredoxin system (TrxR/Trx1) plays a major role in protecting cells from oxidative stress. Disruption of the TrxR-Trx1 system keeps Trx1 in the oxidized state leading to cell death through activation of the ASK1-Trx1 apoptotic pathway. The potential mechanism and ability of tri- and tetra-oligopeptides derived from the canonical -CxxC- motif of the Trx1-active site to mimic and enhance Trx1 cellular activity was examined. The Trx mimetics peptides (TXM) protected insulinoma INS 832/13 cells from oxidative stress induced by selectively inhibiting TrxR with auranofin (AuF). TXM reversed the AuF-effects preventing apoptosis, and increasing cell-viability. The TXM peptides were effective in inhibiting AuF-induced MAPK, JNK and p38MAPKphosphorylation, in correlation with preventing caspase-3 cleavage and thereby PARP-1 dissociation. The ability to form a disulfide-bridge-like conformation was estimated from molecular dynamics simulations. The TXM peptides restored insulin secretion and displayed Trx1 denitrosylase activity. Their potency was 10-100-fold higher than redox reagents like NAC, AD4, or ascorbic acid. Unable to reverse ERK1/2 phosphorylation, TXM-CB3 (NAc-Cys-Pro-Cys amide) appeared to function in part, through inhibiting ASK1-Trx dissociation. These highly effective anti-apoptotic effects of Trx1 mimetic peptides exhibited in INS 832/13 cells could become valuable in treating adverse oxidative-stress related disorders such as diabetes. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {We study a generic model of self-assembling chains that can branch and form networks with branching points (junctions) of arbitrary functionality. The physical realizations include physical gels, wormlike micelles, dipolar fluids, and microemulsions. The model maps the partition function of a solution of branched, self-assembling, mutually avoiding clusters onto that of a Heisenberg magnet in the mathematical limit of zero spin components. As for the calculation of thermodynamic properties as well as the scattering structure factor, the mapping rigorously accounts for all possible cluster configurations, except for closed rings. The model is solved in the mean-field approximation. It is found that despite the absence of any specific interaction between the chains, the presence of the junctions induces an effective attraction between the monomers, which in the case of threefold junctions leads to a first-order reentrant phase separation between a dilute phase consisting mainly of single chains, and a dense network, or two network phases. The model is then modified to predict the structural properties at the mean-field level. Independent of the phase separation, we predict a percolation (connectivity) transition at which an infinite network is formed. The percolation transition partially overlaps with the first-order transition, and is a continuous, nonthermodynamic transition that describes a change in the topology of the system. Our treatment that predicts both the thermodynamic phase equilibria as well as the spatial correlations in the system allows us to treat both the phase separation and the percolation threshold within the same framework. The density-density correlation has the usual Ornstein-Zernicke form at low monomer densities. At higher densities, a peak emerges in the structure factor, signifying the onset of medium-range order in the system. Implications of the results for different physical systems are discussed.},

Direct structural studies show a transition from rigid cylindrical micelles at neutral pH to spherical micelles at ∼ pH 2 upon protonation of salicylate molecules; however, an unanticipated reversion to flexible cylindrical micelles with further decrease in pH was observed. We also observed these microstructure transitions from cylinders at high pH to spherical micelles at intermediate pH to flexible cylindrical micelles at low pH were highly sensitive to temperature. Our results suggest that, in addition to the well-described electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions in cationic surfactant–hydrotrope mixtures, the pH-induced microstructural changes are potentially governed by complementary cation−$\pi$ and hydrogen bond...},

Its aggregation in aqueous solution has been studied using static and dynamic light scattering measurements. The homologue O,O'-bis(sodium 2-dodecylcarboxylate)-p-benzenediol (C(12)$\phi$C(12)) whose spacer only contains a single phenyl group was also examined for comparison. Dynamic light scattering (DLS) revealed the unexpected existence of large aggregates in the solution of C(12)$\phi$(2)C(12). However, C(12)$\phi$C(12) showed rather normal aggregation behavior. Both the results of intrinsic viscosity and light scattering demonstrated a loose structure for the large aggregates of C(12)$\phi$(2)C(12). This behavior was attributed to an extending configuration of C(12)$\phi$(2)C(12) with the two alkyl tails stretching toward the solution due to the rigidity of the long spacer. The large network-like aggregate formation was an inevitable outcome of spontaneously reducing the energy of the system. Freeze-fracture transmission electron microscopy (FF-TEM) images and (1)H NMR measurements supported this speculation. Due to the columnar-like molecular geometry, the large network-like aggregates were directly transformed into rodlike micelles with increasing surfactant concentration. Depending on further micellar growth, the wormlike micelles were finally formed as confirmed by rheological measurements.},

The effect of alkyl chain length on the micellization process in water has been investigated on 1-decyl-3-methylimidazolium ([C10mim]Cl), 1-dodecyl-3-methylimidazolium ([C12mim]Cl), 1- tetradecyl-3-methylimidazolium ([C14mim]Cl) and 1-hexadecyl-3- methylimidazolium ([C16mim]Cl) chlorides, whereas the influence of counter-ion was studied at the micellization of 1-dodecyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride ([C12mim]Cl), bromide ([C12mim]Br), iodide ([C12mim]I), acetate ([C12mim]OAc), methanesulfonate ([C12mim]OMs), toluen sulfonate ([C12mim]OTs), trifluromethane sulfonate ([C12mim]OTf), trifluoro acetate ([C12mim]TFA) and salicylate ([C12mim]Sal) in water. From ITC experimental data, the corresponding standard thermodynamic parameters of micellization (enthalpy, $\Delta$MH0; Gibbs free energy, $\Delta$MG0; entropy, $\Delta$MS0; heat capacity change, $\Delta$Mcp0) were estimated by help of the mass-action model. It was found that SAILs behave mainly like common cationic surfactants, where cmc values are decreasing with the length of the side alkyl chain and exhibit U-shape dependence on temperature. Remarkable influence of counter-ions on cmc and all thermodynamic functions was observed, however the entropy-enthalpy compensation turned out as a matter of fact, arising from the relationship $\Delta$G = $\Delta$H − T$\Delta$S. $\Delta$Mcp0values were further discussed in terms of the removal of solvent accessible surface areas of SAILs and counter-ion from the contact with water after micellization.},

The sphere-to-cylinder growth and branching depends on the concentration, the water-to-surfactant ratio, and the temperature. The unidimensional growth leads to a network of interconnected wormlike micelles. Like most studied linear nonionic surfactants, in this true catanionic system at equimolarity of anionic and cationic surfactant, the curvature toward water increases with temperature, making connections between cylinders less frequent.},

abstract = {Self-assembled copolymer micelles have been widely explored for numerous applications including cosmetic formulations and detergency, drug delivery, and agriculture. In many of these technologies at least trace amounts of surfactants and detergents are present, yet little is known regarding their effect on the copolymer micelle structure. In this paper we examine the influence of a nonionic micelle-forming surfactant, Triton X-100, on spherical, nonionic polymeric micelles composed of poly(butadiene)-co-poly(polyethylene oxide). Using cryo-TEM we find that relatively small surfactant concentrations (less than 1:1 molar ratio) are sufficient to disrupt the copolymer assemblies, and to yield, via dimerization, mixed polymer-surfactant micelles with characteristic diameters. Saturation of the polymeric micelles is reached with approximately 3 mM surfactant (1:8 mol ratio). Upon saturation, and in high surfactant excess, coexistence of two homogeneous micellar populations is found: saturated polymer-surfactant micelles, and much smaller micelles of pure surfactant. The lack of complete demicellization of the polymeric micelles is explained by packing constraints of the polymer hydrophobic chains by the added surfactant. This behavior is found to be characteristic of polymeric molecules with hydrophobic-to-hydrophilic molecular weight ratio close to, or exceeding, 0.75. We further found that structural transitions in polymer-surfactant mixtures are fast, and the systems reach equilibrium at time scales characteristic to the small molecule, in contrast with the slow equilibration in polymer-polymer mixtures.},

The whole number of bubbles likely to form in a single glass is the result of the fine interplay between dissolved CO2, tiny gas pockets trapped within particles acting as bubble nucleation sites, and ascending bubble dynamics. Based on theoretical models combining ascending bubble dynamics and mass transfer equations, the falsely naı̈ve question of how many bubbles are likely to form per glass is discussed in the present work. A theoretical relationship is derived, which provides the whole number of bubbles likely to form per glass, depending on various parameters of both the wine and the glass itself.},

abstract = {It has been known that the addition of bile salts to lecithin organosols induces the formation of reverse wormlike micelles and that the worms are similar to long polymer chains that entangle each other to form viscoelastic solutions. In this study, we further investigated the effects of different bile salts and bile acids on the growth of lecithin reverse worms in cyclohexane and n-decane. We utilized rheological and small-angle scattering techniques to analyze the properties and structures of the reverse micelles. All of the bile salts can transform the originally spherical lecithin reverse micelles into wormlike micelles and their rheological behaviors can be described by the single-relaxation-time Maxwell model. However, their efficiencies to induce the worms are different. In contrast, before phase separation, bile acids can induce only short cylindrical micelles that are not long enough to impart viscoelasticity. We used Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy to investigate the interactions between lecithin and bile salts/acids and found that different bile salts/acids employ different functional groups to form hydrogen bonds with lecithin. Such effects determine the relative positions of the bile salts/acids in the headgroups of lecithin, thus resulting in varying efficiencies to alter the effective critical packing parameter for the formation of wormlike micelles. This work highlights the importance of intermolecular interactions in molecular self-assembly.},

abstract = {Bicellar systems are a fascinating category of versatile lipid assemblies that comprise bilayered disk-shaped nanoaggregates formed in water by long and short alkyl chain phospholipids. Bicelles bridge the gap between micelles and lipid vesicles by combining the attractive properties of both systems. These structures have recently been proposed in dermatological, cosmetic and pharmaceutical applications. Two new binary bicellar systems composed of cholesterol sulphate (SCHOL) and long-chain phospholipids (dimyristoyl-phosphatidylcholine, DMPC, or dipalmitoyl-phosphatidylcholine, DPPC) are characterised herein by differential scanning calorimetry, fluorescence spectroscopy, X-ray scattering and microscopy. Additionally, a comparative study on skin treated with the new SCHOL systems (DMPC/SCHOL and DPPC/SCHOL) and classic DHPC systems (DMPC/DHPC and DPPC/DHPC) was performed. These studies were conducted to determinate how deeply bicelles penetrate into the skin and the extension of their effect on the phase behaviour of stratum corneum (SC) lipids using attenuated total reflectance-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and two-photon excitation fluorescence microscopy. Our results show that SCHOL modified the typical discoidal morphology and the phase behaviour of the systems, inducing coexistence of two phases, liquid-ordered and ripple phases. The effect of the systems on SC lipids depends on their composition and is related to the fluidity of the SC lipid alkyl chains. Thus, systems with DMPC induced more disorder in SC lipids than systems with DPPC, and SCHOL did not modify the lipid arrangement. Perdeuterated systems in the infrared spectroscopy technique supported a different distribution in the tissue for every system. DMPC systems were primarily at the first layers of the SC, whereas DPPC systems were more widely distributed. Systems with SCHOL had enhanced distribution and penetration of bicellar systems throughout the SC.},

@article{Hoffmann2015a,
abstract = {The term "electric birefringence anomaly" is known as the electric birefringence (EB) signal that occurs in solutions of ionically charged anisometric particles in a narrow concentration region. The signal is of opposite sign to the normal birefringence that occurs below and above this narrow concentration region. The normal electric birefringence signals in the dilute and more concentrated regions are due to the orientation of the particles in the direction of the applied electric field. The origin for the anomalous signal was not completely understood until now. The article summarises previous results in which the anomalous results had been observed but not well understood. It shows that the birefringence anomaly occurs in systems as diverse as micellar solutions, polyelectrolytes, solutions of clays, viruses and fibres. In all these systems the anomaly signals are present at the concentration when the length of the colloidal particles including the thickness of the electric double layer are about the same as the mean distance between the colloidal particles. Under these conditions the electric double layers of the particles overlap along the main axis of the particles but not in the direction across the particles. As a consequence of this situation a dipole is built up across the particles by the migration of the counter-ions of the particles in the electric field and this dipole leads to an orientation of the particles perpendicular to the electric field. The anomalous signal can usually be observed simultaneously with the normal signal. The amplitude of the anomalous signal can be larger than the amplitude of the normal signal. As a consequence the total birefringence changes its sign in the anomalous concentration region. The anomaly signal of the clays can also be explained by a fluctuating dipole around the particles, which is due to the fact that the centre of the ionic charges of the particles does not fall on the centre of the ionic charge of the counter-ions. The resulting dipole could also explain the anomaly signal.},

abstract = {The effect of different hydrotropic salts on the microenvironment at the anionic head group region of sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) micelle has been studied through time-resolved fluorescence anisotropy measurements of a solubilized probe, coumarin-153 (C153). The organic cations of the hydrotropic salts used in this study, i.e. aniline hydrochloride (AHC) and o-, m- and p-toluidine hydrochlorides (OTHC, MTHC and PTHC, respectively), differ in their charge to size ratio and hydrophobicity. Present study utilizes the sensitivity of the fluorescence technique to understand the changes in the micropolarity and microviscosity experienced by the fluorescent probe, C153, solubilized in the micellar Stern layer, on addition of different hydrotropic salts. Significant changes are observed in the rotational relaxation dynamics of the probe with increasing concentration of the salts. The changes in the rotational relaxation dynamics clearly reflect the sphere to rod transition in the SDS micelles and correspond nicely with the reported results from dynamic light scattering measurements. The growth behavior of SDS micelles is found to be sensitive to the hydrophobicity of the organic cations. The charge to size ratio of the organic cations also indicated to play a role in inducing the sphere to rod transition in the SDS micelles. The interesting observation made from this study is that the sphere to rod transition of SDS micelles is largely facilitated by the presence of the hydrotropic salts and such a transition is successfully indicated by the simple fluorescence anisotropy measurements of a probe in the micelle carried out in the presence of different hydrotropic salts. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The growth of precipitates is controlled by the internal osmotic pressure, fluid buoyancy, and membrane strength. Additionally, rapid bubble-led growth is observed when silicate concentrations are high. ESEM/EDX analysis confirms compositional gradients within the membranes, and voltage measurements across the membranes during growth show a final potential of around 150-200 mV, indicating that electrochemical gradients are maintained across the membranes as growth proceeds.

abstract = {A pH-responsive threadlike micellar system was developed by mixing alkyl bis(2-hydroxyethyl)methylammonium chloride (EO12) and trans-o-coumaric acid (tOCA). The rheological response of this system to pH is unusual in that it has viscoelasticity at both high and low pH levels, while it shows water-like behaviors at medium pH. Cryogenic transmission electron microscopy (Cryo-TEM) images confirmed the presence of TLMs at pH 3.5 and pH 9.8. This system also had DR (drag reduction) capability at low and high pH. The unusual rheological and micellar responses of this system to pH are caused by the dual pKa's of tOCA.1H NMR and zeta potential results support this hypothesis. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {2-Naphthol (2NOH) was used as a fluorescent probe in order to examine and quantify the changes in hydrogen ion concentration in micelles formed by the zwitterionic 3-(tetradecyldimethylammonium)-propanesulfonate (SB3-14) surfactant or by anionic sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). In the presence of SDS, 2NOH is incorporated into the anionic micelle and the neutral form of the probe becomes the dominant species. The results are consistent with a microenvironment probably with a higher acidity and/or lower polarity in the micellar surface. The addition of SB3-14 generates a plateau at pH 3 to 9 with a fluorescent component of low intensity, which indicates the partial formation of 2NO(-)*, promoted by proton transfer to water. Theoretical results provided information on the structural parameters, emission wavelength, and changes in $\Delta$pK(a) values due to the solvent, which are consistent with a solubilization site similar to aqueous ethanol. Zwitterionic surfactants concentrate anions such as trifluoroacetate in zwitterionic micelles, and as a result, the micellar surface charge becomes negative and promotes hydrogen ion incorporation into the micellar surface. Effects observed on the proton transfer between 2NOH* and anions in zwitterionic micellar solutions are complex and, besides the well-known anion incorporation, include changes in the surface potential and acidity of the surface. Zwitterionic micelles are able to emulate the mostly zwitterionic nature of biological membranes, and in the complex nature of zwitterionic micelles, we found reasons for the selection of zwitterionic headgroups in surfactants in natural systems as major components of biological interfaces.},

Originally it was obtained from the dirt floors of stables, sheep pens, pigeon houses, caverns, and even peasants' cottages; any place manure and refuse accumulated in soil under dry conditions. When these sources became inadequate to meet demand it was manufactured on saltpeter plantations, located in dry climates, where piles of dirt, limestone, and manure were allowed to stand for three to five years while soil microbes oxidized the nitrogen to nitrate—an example of early bioengineering. Extensive deposits of sodium nitrate were mined in the Atacama Desert in northern Chile from 1830 until the mid 1920s when the mines were displaced by the Haber–Ostwald process.},

abstract = {A series of isomeric cationic surfactants (S1-S5) bearing a long alkyl chain that carries a 1,4-phenylene unit and a trimethyl ammonium headgroup was synthesized; the location of the phenyl ring within the alkyl tail was varied in an effort to understand its influence on the amphiphilic properties of the surfactants. The cmc's of the surfactants were estimated using ionic conductivity measurements and isothermal calorimetric titrations (ITC); the values obtained by the two methods were found to be in excellent agreement. The ITC measurements provided additional insight into the various thermodynamic parameters associated with the micellization process. Although all five surfactants have exactly the same molecular formula, their micellar properties were seen to vary dramatically depending on the location of the phenyl ring; the cmc was seen to decrease by almost an order of magnitude when the phenyl ring was moved from the tail end (cmc of S1 is 23 mM) to the headgroup region (cmc of S5 is 3 mM). In all cases, the enthalpy of micellization was negative but the entropy of micellization was positive, suggesting that in all of these systems the formation of micelles is both enthalpically and entropically favored. As expected, the decrease in cmc values upon moving the phenyl ring from the tail end to the headgroup region is accompanied by an increase in the thermodynamic driving force ($\Delta$G) for micellization. To understand further the differences in the micellar structure of these surfactants, small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) measurements were carried out; these measurements reveal that the aggregation number of the micelles increases as the cmc decreases. This increase in the aggregation number is also accompanied by an increase in the asphericity of the micellar aggregate and a decrease in the fractional charge. Geometric packing arguments are presented to account for these changes in aggregation behavior as a function of phenyl ring location.},

Wormlike micelles are elongated flexible self-assembled structures created from the aggregation of amphiphiles and their resulting dynamic networks have gained attention for a number of uses, particularly in the oil industry.Written by experts, Wormlike Micelles describes the latest developments in the field providing an authoritative guide on the subject. The book starts with an introductory chapter giving an overview of the area and then looks at the three key topics of new wormlike micelle systems, characterization and applications. New systems covered in the first part include reverse wormlike micelles and stimuli-responsive wormlike micelles. The second part explores cutting-edge techniques that have led to advances in the understanding of their structure and dynamics, including direct imaging techniques and the combination of rheology with small-angle neutron scattering techniques. Finally, the book reviews their use in oil and gas well treatments as well as surfactant drag reducing solutions.Aimed at postgraduate students and researchers, this text is essential reading for anyone interested in soft matter systems.},

abstract = {Wormlike micelles formed by the addition to cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) of a range of aromatic cosolutes with small molecular variations in their structure were systematically studied. Phenol and derivatives of benzoate and cinnamate were used, and the resulting mixtures were studied by oscillatory, steady-shear rheology, and the microstructure was probed by small-angle neutron scattering. The lengthening of the micelles and their entanglement result in remarkable viscoelastic properties, making rheology a useful tool to assess the effect of structural variations of the cosolutes on wormlike micelle formation. For a fixed concentration of CTAB and cosolute (200 mmol L(-1)), the relaxation time decreases in the following order: phenol {\textgreater} cinnamate{\textgreater} o-hydroxycinnamate {\textgreater} salicylate {\textgreater} o-methoxycinnamate {\textgreater} benzoate {\textgreater} o-methoxybenzoate. The variations in viscoelastic response are rationalized by using Mulliken population analysis to map out the electronic density of the cosolutes and quantify the barrier to rotation of specific groups on the aromatics. We find that the ability of the group attached to the aromatic ring to rotate is crucial in determining the packing of the cosolute at the micellar interface and thus critically impacts the micellar growth and, in turn, the rheological response. These results enable us for the first time to propose design rules for the self-assembly of the surfactants and cosolutes resulting in the formation of wormlike micelles with the cationic surfactant CTAB.},

The Marangoni flow is generated by the pH gradient in a maze filled with an alkaline solution of a fatty acid by introducing a hydrogel block soaked with an acid at the exit. The pH gradient changes the protonation rate of fatty acid molecules, which translates into the surface tension gradient at the liquid-air interface through the maze. Fluid flow maintained by the surface tension gradient (Marangoni flow) can drag water-soluble dye particles toward low pH (exit) at the liquid-air interface. Dye particles placed at the entrance of the maze dissolve during this motion, thus exhibiting and finding the shortest path and all possible paths in a maze.},

Viscoelastic solutions are formed in CTAB and C16SE systems upon addition of lipophilic nonionic surfactant C12EO3. The zero-shear viscosity shows a maximum at a certain mixing fraction of C12EO3, except in the case of the aqueous CTAB/C12EO3system in the absence of salt. The rheological properties are strongly affected by the addition of salt to the CTAB systems but they remain unaltered in the case of C16SE systems. In ionic systems, the mixing fraction of C12EO3for the maximum viscosity depends on salt concentration. {\textcopyright} 2004 Published by Elsevier B.V.},

For micelle-forming 1-alkyl-4-n-dodecylpyridinium iodide surfactants (alkyl ) C1-C3), enthalpies of micelle formation show no trend with respect to 1-alkyl chain length. Changes in molecular architecture of the counterion, however, have a large influence on the thermodynamics of micelle formation. It is shown that next to solvation, London dispersion interactions, counterion (substituent)-water interactions, and the microenvironment of counterions adsorbed to micellar surfaces play an important role in determining the exothermicities of micelle formation. Isobaric heat capacities of micelle formation show that the formation of wormlike micelles for salicylate-containing cationic surfactants is due to a favorable microenvironment for salicylate counterions in the Stern layer of micelles.},

Old as well as new Au(i) and Au(iii) compounds have been used and designed with an aim of targeting cellular components that are implicated in the onset or progression of cancers, rheumatoid arthiritis, viral and parasitic diseases. In addition, new disease targets have been found for gold compounds that have given insight into the mechanism of action of these compounds, as well as in the molecular pathophysiology of human diseases. Here we discuss the rationale for the design and use of gold compounds that have specific and selective targets in cells to alleviate the symptoms of a range of human diseases. We summarise the most recent findings in this research and our own discoveries to show that gold compounds can be developed to become versatile and powerful drugs for diseases caused by dysfunction of selenol and thiol containing proteins.},

Thus, the addition of alkali metal perchlorates accelerates the acid hydrolysis of 2-(p-heptoxyphenyl)-1,3-dioxolane, HPD, in the presence of SB3-14 micelles, which depends on the local proton concentration at the micelle surface. The addition of metal chlorides to solutions of such perchlorate-modified SB3-14 micelles decreases both the negative zeta potential of the micelles and the observed rate constant for acid hydrolysis of HPD. The effect of the monovalent cations Li(+), Na(+), and K(+) is smaller than that of the divalent cations Be(2+), Mg(2+), and Ca(2+), and much smaller than that of the trivalent cations Al(3+), La(3+), and Er(3+). The major factor responsible for this cation valence dependence of these effects is shown to be electrostatic in nature, reflecting the strong dependence of the micellar surface potential on the cation valence. The fact that the salt effects are not identical after correction for the electrostatic effects indicates that additional secondary nonelectrostatic effects may contribute as well.},

Well-established principles of coordination chemistry provide an explanation for the remarkable strengths and selectivities shown by most of these extractants. Reagents which achieve high selectivity when transporting metal cations or metal salts into a water-immiscible solvent usually operate in the inner coordination sphere of the metal and provide donor atom types or dispositions which favour the formation of particularly stable neutral complexes that have high solubility in the hydrocarbons commonly used in recovery processes. In the extraction of metalates, the structures of the neutral assemblies formed in the water-immiscible phase are usually not well defined and the cationic reagents can be assumed to operate in the outer coordination spheres. The formation of secondary bonds in the outer sphere using, for example, electrostatic or H-bonding interactions are favoured by the low polarity of the water-immiscible solvents.},

With added salt of 0.1 and 1 M KBr, the slow growth is not observed and the entanglement seems to exist right from the lowest concentration used in this study (0.07 wt {\%}). The variation of self diffusion coefficient with concentration in the presence of salt is found to be in accordance with the recent theoretical predictions for the scaling of the diffusion constant with concentration.

abstract = {A novel pH-switchable anionic wormlike micellar system has been developed by simply changing pH value of natural erucic acid solutions without needing specialized organic synthesis or addition of hydrotropes. Through rheology, optical transmittance, and cryo-TEM observation, it was found that at 60 °C, the 100. mM erucic acid solutions transform from low viscous emulsion-like fluids to viscoelastic hydrogels when the pH is increased from 8.03 to 12.35, and when the pH is cycled between 9.02 and 12.35, the viscosity of the solutions varies correspondingly between 2 and 200,000. mPa. s, five orders of magnitude in viscosity range. Such a reversible switch can be easily cycled more than four times without any deterioration. In addition, when the pH is fixed between 9.0 and 12.35, the solutions shift to highly elastic solid-like gels with decreasing temperature. These pH-switchable and temperature-sensitive rheological properties are attributed to the presence of carboxylic groups in the erucic acid molecules. With increasing pH, erucic acid is converted into an anionic surfactant, sodium erucate, which self-assembles into aggregates evolving from spherical micelles to wormlike micelles; when temperature is decreased, these disordered micellar structures become highly ordered under the effect of crystallization of hydrophobic erucate chains, forming opaque solid-like hydrogels. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

The kinetics of the morphological transition was directly tracked by time-resolved (ultra) small-angle X-ray scattering coupled with rapid mixing of the block copolymer components by a stopped flow apparatus. The transformation from cylindrical to spherical micelles upon changing the mixing ratio of the copolymers was reversible, and the process occurred via the random scission of the cylindrical micelles along their contours. The reverse transition from spherical to cylindrical micelles was found to be a slow process with high activation energy.},

abstract = {Surfactant drag-reducing additives are very promising for saving pumping energy in recirculation systems such as district heating and cooling systems because of their "self-repairability" after mechanical degradation compared to polymer drag-reducing additives, which degrade irreversibly. The effectiveness of cationic surfactant drag-reducing additives, as indicated by their effective drag-reduction temperatures and Reynolds number ranges, depends on the chemical structures and concentrations of the surfactants and counterions. In this paper, the effects of the surfactant (alkyl chain length, saturated/unsaturated chain, odd/even numbers of carbons, and surfactant headgroup) and counterion (size, polarity, etc.) chemical structures on surfactant drag reduction, as well as three physical properties postulated to be associated with surfactant drag reduction, are addressed. Shear-induced structure (SIS), viscoelasticity (in the forms of nonzero first normal stress difference, quick recoil, and stress overshoot), and high extensional/ shear viscosity ratios are three rheological characteristics found in many drag-reducing surfactant solutions. It has frequently been postulated that they are vital to surfactant drag reduction.

abstract = {We studied the effect of a trace amount of perfumes and oils on the rheological properties of micellar solutions formed in a water/sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)/tri(oxyethylene) dodecyl ether (C12EO3) system which gives a maximum zero-shear viscosity as a function of surfactant mixing fraction due to wormlike micelle formation. By adding high-polarity perfumes and oils (9-decen-1-ol, 1-decanol, l-menthol, geraniol and $\alpha$-terpineol), the viscosity peak shifts to lower hydrophobic surfactant composition and the degree of the viscosity peak shift is the largest for the linear-chain molecules and smaller for the branched or cyclic molecules. Dynamic frequency tests show that the zero-shear viscosity behavior for different high-polarity perfume and oil systems varies due to the change in the relaxation time behavior. The linear-chain molecules can penetrate well in the palisade layer of micelles and the penetration could be interrupted by branched or cyclic molecular architecture. On the other hand, by adding low-polarity perfumes and oils (p-cymene, hexahydrocumene, butylbenzene, d-limonene and decane), the behavior of the viscosity curve is quite different for decane and for other molecules, i.e. decane decreases the viscosity peak without shift of surfactant mixing fraction whereas other molecules behave as high-polarity molecules. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Medical and therapeutic value of gold has been recognized thousands of years ago, but its rational use in medicine has not begun until the early 1920s. Cisplatin is one of the first metal-containing compounds with anti-cancer activity discovered in the 1960s. Despite the fact that cisplatin treatment is efficient for several types of solid tumors, its effectiveness is limited by toxic side effects and tumor resistance that often leads to the occurrence of secondary malignancies. Since gold(III) is isoelectronic with platinum(II) and tetracoordinate gold(III) complexes have the same square-planar geometries as cisplatin, the anticancer activity of gold(III) compounds has been investigated. Previous studies suggested that, in contrast to cisplatin, gold complexes target proteins but not DNA. Recently, we have investigated gold(III) dithiocarbamates for their anticancer activity and showed that their primary target is the proteasome. Treatment of human breast tumor-bearing nude mice with a gold(III) dithiocarbamate complex resulted in significant inhibition of tumor growth, associated with proteasome inhibition and massive apoptosis induction in vivo. Better understanding of physiological processing of gold compounds will provide a rational basis for their further development into novel anticancer drugs.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}In this report, the status quo and recent progress in electrokinetics are reviewed. Practical rules are recommended for performing electrokinetic measurements and interpreting their results in terms of well-defined quantities, the most familiar being the z-potential or electrokinetic potential. This potential is a property of charged interfaces, and it should be independent of the technique used for its determination. However, often the z-potential is not the only property electrokinetically characterizing the electrical state of the interfacial region; the excess conductivity of the stagnant layer is an additional parameter. The requirement to obtain the z-potential is that electrokinetic theories be correctly used and applied within their range of validity. Basic theories and their application ranges are discussed. A thorough description of the main electrokinetic methods is given; special attention is paid to their ranges of applicability as well as to the validity of the underlying theoretical models. Electrokinetic consistency tests are proposed in order to assess the validity of the z-potentials obtained. The recommendations given in the report apply mainly to smooth and homogeneous solid particles and plugs in aqueous systems; some attention is paid to nonaqueous media and less ideal surfaces.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

@article{Griffin1954,
abstract = {?it/as Powder Company, tt • ilmington, Del. IN THE PAST FIFTEEN or twenty years, there has been a tremendous growth in the field of surfactants. The term surfactants, as used here, includes emulsifiers, wetting agents, suspending agents, detergents, anti-foam compounds, and many others. Despite widespread interest in all types of surfactants, there has been no utilitarian method of classifying them. There has been division according to ionization, chemical type, and by popular (often ambiguous) nomenclature. The surfactant used in practically all formulations prior to the 1930's was soap. In the mid 1930's the supremacy of soap was challenged, first by sulfonates and sulfate-type ionic surfactants, and shortly thereafter by the non-ionics. In the past few years blends of non-ionic and anionic sur-factants have become increasingly popular. Throughout this period, cat-ionic surfactants have seen increased use but not to the same degree as that of either anionic or non-ionic products. The biggest difficulty with surfactants today, at least from the stand-point of those who have to choose them, is the staggering number that are available. Each manufacturer tries to provide one or more of his own products that is suitable for every need and therefore each has a tremendous selection. The large number of surfactants available, coupled with the fact that application problems are becoming increasingly difficult, is mak-ing the need for a suitable system of selection of surfactants more and more critical. Any emulsion chemist who works with surfactants for a few years soon recognizes that there is a correlation between their behavior and their solubility in water. For example, he will use a water-soluble surfactant or blend to make an oil-in-water emulsion. He will also use a water-soluble surfactant for solubilization and an almost completely water-soluble surfactant as a detergent. All the products of these applications may be said to exhibit aqueous characteristics; that is, they dilute readily * Presented at the May 14, 1954, Meeting, New York City. 249 • 50 JOURNAL OF THE SOCIETY OF COSMETIC CHEMISTS with water and conduct electricity. For these purposes the emulsion chem-ist would under no circumstances use an oil-soluble surfactant. However, to make a water-in-oil emulsion, to couple water-soluble materials into an oil, or to make a dry-cleaning detergent, all of which are non-aqueous sys-tems, he would choose an oil-soluble surfactant. This relationship of behavior and water solubility that is followed by most experienced emulsion chemists is so inexact in its usual form that it is only of value as a basis of thinking. We have been successful in assigning nu-merical values to surfactants, thereby providing a system of classification that is related to their behavior and to their solubility in water. This method, called the HLB method from the term Hydrophile-Lipophile Bal-ance, is based on the premise that all surfactants combine hydrophilic and lipophilic groups in one molecule and that the proportion between the weight percentages of these two groups for non-ionic surfactants is an indication of the behavior that may be expected from that product. The HLB value is useful because it allows a prediction of the action that may be expected from a surfactant; for example a low value, about 4, will be a water-in-oil emulsifier; a high value, about 16, will be a solubilizer. What is referred to here is the type of behavior that can be expected, rather than the efficiency with which this will be accomplished. In our laboratory the behavior ofsurfactants in relationship to their hydro-philic nature was first recognized in emulsion studies. When two non-ionic emulsifiers, one hydrophilic and the other lipophilic, were mixed in varying ratios the efficiency of the blend as an emulsifier for a given oil went through a maximum. Using pairs of different surfactants to emulsify the same oil, it was apparent that this maximum occurred at the same weight percentage of hydrophilic substance in the surfactant blend. Essentially therefore, the HLB value is a function of the weight percentage of the hydrophilic portion of the molecule of a non-ionic surfactant. HLB values may be calculated for non-ionic surfactants or may be deter-mined experimentally. The experimental procedure is long and laborious and was described a few years ago [J. Soc. COSMETIC CHEM., 1,311-326 (1949)].},

abstract = {There is much recent evidence showing that mitochondria play a critical role in the regulation of apoptosis (programmed cell death), making them an attractive target for the design of new anticancer drugs. A variety of different strategies targeting mitochondria for cancer therapy have been described in recent literature. Several different classes of gold-based compounds (in both Au(I) and Au(III) oxidation states) have attracted interest as potential antitumour agents and there is evidence that many act by mechanisms involving mitochondrial cell death pathways. Two distinct classes of Au(I) phosphine complexes display antitumour properties, these having either linear two-coordinate, or tetrahedral four-coordinate geometries. Both classes appear to target mitochondria, but different mechanisms are likely to be involved, related to their differing propensity to undergo ligand exchange reactions with biological ligands. The anti-arthritic Au(I) phosphine drug, auranofin, has been shown to induce apoptosis via selective inhibition of the mitochondrial isoform of thioredoxin reductase, an enzyme which has emerged as a potential new drug target. Gold(I) compounds are among the most potent known inhibitors of thioredoxin reductase, attributable to binding of Au(I) to the redox-active selenocysteine residue. On the other hand [Au(dppe)2]+, and related tetrahedral Au(I) phosphine complexes, do not undergo ligand exchange reactions as readily as two-coordinate linear Au(I) complexes. Their antitumour activity may stem from the lipophilic, cationic properties, as for other delocalised lipophilic cations that accumulate in mitochondria. Examples from our own recent work on different types of Au(I) phosphine and N-heterocyclic carbene compounds under investigation as potential mitochondrial targeting antitumour agents are reported here. We also review recent related literature on auranofin and a variety of Au(III) antitumour compounds which either inhibit mitochondrial thioredoxin reductase, or induce apoptosis by other mitochondrial cell death pathways.

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {Many nanometre-sized building blocks will readily assemble into macroscopic structures. If the process is accompanied by effective control over the interactions between the blocks and all entropic effects, then the resultant structures will be ordered with a precision hard to achieve with other fabrication methods. But it remains challenging to use self-assembly to design systems comprised of different types of building blocks-to realize novel magnetic, plasmonic and photonic metamaterials, for example. A conceptually simple idea for overcoming this problem is the use of 'encodable' interactions between building blocks; this can in principle be straightforwardly implemented using biomolecules. Strategies that use DNA programmability to control the placement of nanoparticles in one and two dimensions have indeed been demonstrated. However, our theoretical understanding of how to extend this approach to three dimensions is limited, and most experiments have yielded amorphous aggregates and only occasionally crystallites of close-packed micrometre-sized particles. Here, we report the formation of three-dimensional crystalline assemblies of gold nanoparticles mediated by interactions between complementary DNA molecules attached to the nanoparticles' surface. We find that the nanoparticle crystals form reversibly during heating and cooling cycles. Moreover, the body-centred-cubic lattice structure is temperature-tuneable and structurally open, with particles occupying only approximately 4{\%} of the unit cell volume. We expect that our DNA-mediated crystallization approach, and the insight into DNA design requirements it has provided, will facilitate both the creation of new classes of ordered multicomponent metamaterials and the exploration of the phase behaviour of hybrid systems with addressable interactions.},

@article{Alargova1998a,
abstract = {To interpret quantitatively experimental data for the growth of rodlike anionic surfactant micelles in the presence of Al3+ ions, we undertook experimental and theoretical investigations. We determined the micelle size, shape, and interactions by light scattering and examined the binding of Al3+ ions to the micelles by ultrafiltration. Independent static and dynamic light scattering measurements indicated that the effect of the micelle-micelle interactions in these solutions can be neglected. The major factor promoting the micelle growth turns out to be the binding of Al3+ ions to the micelle surfaces, which considerably affects the standard chemical potential of the aggregated surfactant molecules and can alter the micellization constant by orders of magnitude. The latter effect was described theoretically. The model of micelle growth, extended in this way, compared well with the experimental data. The model provides a quantitative description of the micelle size and charge as functions of the surfactant and electrolyte concentrations. It turns out that the rodlike micelles have a lower surface charge than the spherical ones, and this makes their growth energetically favorable. A practical application may follow from the markedly greater solubilization efficiency of the studied rodlike micelles compared to the spherical ones.},

abstract = {The rheo-optical analysis of polymer solutions and melts is a critical tool in elucidating their molecular response to flow fields. We therefore evaluate the measurement of flow-induced birefringence (orientation) under extension in microfluidic cross-slots, whose flow kinematics was examined by microparticle image velocimetry. The effects of planar extension on the (non) linear viscoelasticity of wormlike micellar surfactant solutions (comprising either cetyltrimethylammonium bromide or cetylpyridinium chloride in aqueous sodium salicylate) were measured. The effect of wall shear was found to be negligible compared to extension. The birefringence is linear (indicating the validity of the stress-optical rule) for very small extensional Weissenberg numbers, as expected. This rule fails, however, when a sharp birefringence band appears at modest Weissenberg number (indicating the alignment of wormlike micelles along the outflow direction). Experiments that measure average birefringence may misidentify the point of failure of the stress-optical rule. These bands also scatter light and appear in transmittance images, yet with distinctive features. At higher flow rates, the birefringent band broadens after the peak retardation saturates, but the transmittance band remains narrow and eventually the flow becomes asymmetric. This asymmetric transition is elasticity-induced, and no shear banding is observed by particle velocimetry: the velocity profiles remain linear, while the flow becomes asymmetric. These phenomena are common to both fluids studied, but the stress-optical coefficient and the Weissenberg numbers at saturated birefringence differ quantitatively, possibly due to differences in micellar length and scission kinetics, as determined from linear viscoelastic measurements.},

By tailoring the Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian, we created an attractively interacting ensemble of ultracold bosons at negative temperature that is stable against collapse for arbitrary atom numbers. The quasimomentum distribution develops sharp peaks at the upper band edge, revealing thermal equilibrium and bosonic coherence over several lattice sites. Negative temperatures imply negative pressures and open up new parameter regimes for cold atoms, enabling fundamentally new many-body states.},

abstract = {Several surfactant molecules self-assemble in solution to form long, cylindrical, flexible wormlike micelles. These micelles can be entangled with each other leading to viscoelastic phases. The rheological properties of such phases are very interesting and have been the subject of a large number of experimental and theoretical studies in recent years. We shall report on our recent work on the macrorheology, microrheology and nonlinear flow behaviour of dilute aqueous solutions of a surfactant CTAT (Cetyltrimethylammonium Tosilate). This system forms elongated micelles and exhibits strong viscoelasticity at low concentrations (sim 0.9 wt{\%}) without the addition of electrolytes. Microrheology measurements of G(omega) have been done using diffusing wave spectroscopy which will be compared with the conventional frequency sweep measurements done using a cone and plate rheometer. The second part of the paper deals with the nonlinear rheology where the measured shear stress sigma is a nonmonotonic function of the shear rate dotgamma. In stress-controlled experiments, the shear stress shows a plateau for dotgamma larger than some critical strain rate, similar to the earlier reports on CPyCl/NaSal system. Cates et al have proposed that the plateau is a signature of mechanical instability in the form of shear bands. We have carried out extensive experiments under controlled strain rate conditions, to study the time-dependence of shear stress. The measured time series of shear stress has been analysed in terms of correlation integrals and Lyapunov exponents to show unambiguously that the behaviour is typical of low dimensional dynamical systems.},

abstract = {The fluorescence lifetime strongly depends on the immediate environment of the fluorophore. Time-resolved fluorescence measurements of the enhanced forms of ECFP and EYFP in water-glycerol mixtures were performed to quantify the effects of the refractive index and viscosity on the fluorescence lifetimes of these proteins. The experimental data show for ECFP and EYFP two fluorescence lifetime components: one short lifetime of about 1 ns and a longer lifetime of about 3.7 ns of ECFP and for EYFP 3.4. The fluorescence of ECFP is very heterogeneous, which can be explained by the presence of two populations: a conformation (67{\%} present) where the fluorophore is less quenched than in the other conformation (33{\%} present). The fluorescence decay of EYFP is much more homogeneous and the amplitude of the short fluorescence lifetime is about 5{\%}. The fluorescence anisotropy decays show that the rotational correlation time of both proteins scales with increasing viscosity of the solvent similarly as shown earlier for GFP. The rotational correlation times are identical for ECFP and EYFP, which can be expected since both proteins have the same shape and size. The only difference observed is the slightly lower initial anisotropy for ECFP as compared to the one of EYFP.},

abstract = {Self-assembly systems of stimuli-responsive molecules possess the capability of altering its morphologies and properties when receiving external signals (variations in pH value, temperature, light, etc), which has generated emerging applications, and therefore, attracted great interests. However, revealing mechanisms of stimuli-induced self-assembly morphology transition is still in its infancy and experimentally challenging. In this work, we studied the pH-induced self-assembly of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) and potassium phthalic acid (PPA) mixtures by coarse-grained (CG) molecular dynamics (MD) simulation, aiming to give insights into the pH-responsive self-assembly behavior. We simulated the self-assembly of CTAB/PPA mixtures, and obtained spherical, rod-like, and threadlike micelles depending on pH value and PPA/CTAB ratio. Besides, we found that the length of rod-like micelles fluctuated with the increase of PPA/CTAB ratio, and that the self-assembling morphology shifted between rod-like and threadlike micelles when fixing the PPA/CTAB ratio at 4:6 and varying the pH value. With analyzing the net charge number around the CTAB micelles, the arrangement and distribution of CTAB and PPA molecules in micelles, we concluded that the electrostatic shielding and space location-obstruct of PPA play a key role in the pH-induced self-assembly. This work revealed molecular-level information and mechanisms of the pH-induced self-assembly of CTAB/PPA mixtures, which is expected to trigger further understanding and studies on pH-responsive self-assembly behavior.},

abstract = {S EVERAL years since, the writer had occasion to examine the literature concerning the practice of medicine as i t had existed in ancient Egypt.' While these studies were being made it was noted that the Egyptians had advanced considerably in what might be called the "chemical arts" and that they had made many true, chemical discoveries* which were of great use to them in numerous practical ways. Fur-ther, it appeared that but few attempts had been made to sort out these fads from the great masses of litera-ture through which they were scattered and to bring them collectively and briefly to the attention of modern chemists. That is the object of this paper. In order to understand the progress that the ancient Egyptians had made in chemistry and the chemical arts i t is necessary to know something of the historical background of this remarkable people and to survey their general knowledge of such of the arts and sciences as they had acquired. It sfiould be understood that the Egyptians in general did not possess an inquiring mind and that ordmarily they would not conduct experiments merely for the purpose of satisfying curi-osity or gaining knowledge. It is not to be expected, therefore, that their chemistry would advance beyond the purely practical stages. It is believed that the Egyptians came originally from south-central Asia and that they entered the Nile Valley across the Isthmus of Suez. However, their exact origin and the date of their migration are alike unknown. The Egyptians were a dark-skinned, Cau-casian people of great intelligence. Herodotus, who visited Egypt twenty-four centuries ago, says2: "The ' WARREN, L. E., "Pharmacy and medicine in ancient Egypt," J. Am. Pherm.

abstract = {The effect of the surfactant structure on the mechanical and structural properties of surfactant based photorheological fluids are presented in this paper. Cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTABr) mixed with trans-o-methoxycinnamic acid in a basic environment can form photosensitive systems. The driving force is the ability of surfactant molecules to form wormlike micelles in the presence of the anionic photosensitive additive. Taking into account that slight changes in the surfactant monomer's structure can induce drastic modifications of the micellar aggregate features, the role the of the nature of the counterion (in the CTAX type surfactants) or the headgroup size (CTRABr type surfactants) and its influence on the mechanical properties of surfactant based photorheological fluids using trans-o-methoxycinnamic acid (trans-OMCA) as additive were investigated. Rheological studies reported in this paper show that the viscosity of these systems drastically varies only by changing the nature of the surfactant counterion. Moreover, by increasing the bulk simply by replacing the three methyl groups with three ethyl groups in the surfactant headgroup moiety, the viscosity drastically decreases. Highly photosensitive PR fluids can be further obtained using cetyltrimethylammonium trans-o-methoxycinnamate (CTAOMC) as surfactant at neutral pH. In addition to the complete rheological characterization carried out by means of the application of both a steady shear and a dynamic shear stress, a 1H NMR and NOESY study was also performed.},

To understand the effect of the different isomers on the molecular level, we employed atomistic molecular dynamics simulations to study systems containing infinitely long cylindrical DTAC micelles in aqueous solutions of the sodium salts of all three isomers of HB at a temperature and a pressure of 298.15 K and 1 atm. In all studied systems, the number of DTAC unimers is identical to the number of HB anions. At this concentration, the initially cylindrical micelles remain stable, irrespective of the nature of the isomer, whereas micelles rapidly disintegrated in the absence of HB anions. The HB isomers decrease the line density of unimers along the micellar axis and its concomitant thickness in the order o-HB {\textgreater} m-HB {\textgreater} p-HB. It is further observed that o-HB anions penetrate more deeply into the micellar core, induce a more ordered internal structure of the micelle, and are oriented more strongly than the other two isomers. In addition, the ortho isomer shows two different preferential orientations with respect to the radial direction of the cylindrical micelle; it can either be incorporated almost completely into the micelle or it can be attached through hydrogen bonding to one of those o-HB anions that are already incorporated into the micelle, and thus stick out of the micellar surface.},

For infinitesimal titrations, the titration heat is independent of the cell type employed, and the interpretation of the titration heat depends on the titrant composition and on the experiment type.

abstract = {Upon the addition of a short EO chain nonionic surfactant, poly(oxyethylene) dodecyl ether (C12EOn), to dilute micellar solution of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) above a particular concentration, a sharp increase in viscosity occurs and a highly viscoelastic micellar solution is formed. The oscillatory-shear rheological behavior of the viscoselastic solutions can be described by the Maxwell model at low shear frequency and combined Maxwell-Rouse model at high shear frequency. This property is typical of wormlike micelles entangled to form a transient network. It is found that when C12EO4 in the mixed system is replaced by C12EO3 the micellar growth occurs more effectively. However, with the further decrease in EO chain length, phase separation occurs before a viscoelastic solution is formed. As a result, the maximum zero-shear viscosity is observed at an appropriate mixing fraction of surfactant in the SDS-C12EO3 system. We also investigated the micellar growth in the mixed surfactant systems by means of small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). It was found from the SAXS data that the one-dimensional growth of micelles was obtained in all the SDS-C12EOn (n=0-4) aqueous solutions. In a short EO chain C12EOn system, the micelles grow faster at a low mixing fraction of nonionic surfactant.},

abstract = {Weused cryo-TEM and light scattering to study the micellar growth and subsequent network formation in aqueous solutions of the nonionic surfactant C12E5. Cryo-TEM shows the first direct evidence for the existence of connected topology in the vicinity of the critical point and the two-phase separation curve of the C12E5/water micellar system. The coexisting phases within the two-phase region consist of one concentrated and one dilute network of interconnected cylindrical micelles. These findings are consistent with the recent theoretical explanation of criticality and phase separation in certain nonionic surfactant systems as resulting from entropic attraction between network junctions. Away from the two-phase separation curve, we have identified uniaxial micellar growth, with increasing temperature and concentration, into long threadlike micelles. From the power-law dependence of the radius of gyration, RG,z, and the hydrodynamic diameter, D hH, on the molecular weight (RG,z, D hH ∼ Mw$\nu$), we find that these threadlike micelles have properties resembling those of flexible polymers in a good solvent ($\nu$∼0.6). Static and dynamic light scattering show that the mean micelle contour length L B increases as c0.5 (c is the surfactant concentration) in agreement with theory. Finally,weshow that the end-cap energyEc increases linearly with temperature. Introduction},

abstract = {Viscoelastic properties of aqueous solutions of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) containing sodium salicylate (NaSal) were examined by varying the CTAB, CD, and NaSal, CS;, concentrations. The results were compared with those of flexible-chain polymer solutions. With increasing salt-to-detergent ratio, CSCD-1, up to a certain critical value close to 1 for the solutions of a given CD, the rheological behavior changed from that of low molecular weight polymer solutions in which the polymer chains are not entangling to behavior similar to that of high molecular weight polymer solutions in which polymer chains are fully entangling. These results suggest that threadlike micelles composed of CTAB/NaSal complexes began to form as CSCD-1 increased, resulting in an entanglement network exhibiting pronounced viscoelasticity. However, at high CSCD-1 above the critical value, their behavior can be represented by a Maxwell model with a constant plateau compliance JN0 and a single relaxation time $\tau$m. Interestingly, JN0 was proportional to CD-2.2 but independent of CSCD-1, but the relaxation time $\tau$m decreased with increasing CSCD-1. The complex dependence of $\tau$m of all the solutions at high CSCD-1 may be reduced to a single composite function of CSCD-1/2. These results suggest that relaxation of the entanglement network took place by chemical processes involving actual breakdown and re-formation of the threadlike micelles. {\textcopyright} 1987 American Chemical Society.},

abstract = {Effects of a hydrotropic salt, sodium salicylate (NaSal), on the dynamic behavior of cationic dodecyltrimethylammonium bromide (DTAB) micelles as studied using dynamic light scattering (DLS) and quasielastic neutron scattering (QENS) techniques are reported here. DLS study showed that the addition of NaSal leads to a decrease in the apparent diffusion coefficient of the whole micelle indicating micellar growth. QENS data analysis suggested that observed dynamics involves two distinct motions, lateral motion of the surfactant over the curved micellar surface and localized segmental motion of the surfactant. It is found that the addition of NaSal slows down the lateral motion of DTAB while the localized segmental motion of the DTAB chain is not affected much. An atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulation was performed to gain further insight into the underlying phenomena. MD simulation results are found to be consistent with the experimental observations. MD simulation revealed that location of the salicylate ions on the micellar surface and their strong electrostatic association with their oppositely charged surfactant headgroup are the major factors in slowing down the lateral motion of the DTAB molecule.

abstract = { We consider the electrostatics of charged, cylindrical micelles with spherical end-caps. In the semidilute regime (volume fraction ? {\textless}{\textless} 1), and with no added salt, a model calculation which includes nonlinearities suggests that Coulomb interactions result in an additional contribution to the free energy of an end-cap that modifies the growth law for the average micelle size. In some cases, the micelle size varies approximately as ? (1/2)(1+?), where ? {\textgreater} 0 depends on the renormalized coulomb charge of an end cap. These results may help explain anomalies, seen at low added salt, in recent experiments on the dynamics of worm-like micelles. },

For mixed micelles of cationic fluorocarbon-nonionic hydrocarbon surfactants, this modified equation can be tested by measuring the mixed cmc, surface potential, aggregation number, and molar volumes. The mixed cmc curves are well fitted with the calculated curves by the modified equation as a function of cationic surfactant molar fraction. The interaction between the surfactants is not so repulsive as expected from the regular solution theory. In addition, the mixed micelles with various mole fractions exist in a wide mixing region and the size of mixed micelles having charge is fairly small. [References: 24]},

abstract = {Glass production is thought to date to*2500 BCE and glass had found numerous uses by the height of the Roman Empire. The modern application of glass to chemical apparatus (beakers, flasks, stills, etc.) was quite limited, however, due to a lack of glass durability under both rapid temperature changes and chemical attack. In the mid-1200s, this began to change as the glassmakers of Venice and Murano began blending previous Roman methods with raw materials from the Levant, as well as developing pretreatment and purification methods of the raw materials used. The combination of these practices resulted in a new glass with a strength and high melting point suitable for use in chemical apparatus. The ability to produce vessels from glass allowed much greater freedom and versatility in the design of laboratory glassware. The resulting improved glass technology led to the invention of eyeglasses, significantly extending the intellectual lifespan of the average scholar. In addition, the freedom of design provided by glass resulted in a vast improvement in still design, which in turn allowed the isolation of important species such as alcohol and the mineral acids. This text provides an overview of the history and chemistry of glass technology from its origins in antiquity to its dramatic expansion in the thirteenth century, then concluding with its impact on society in general, particularly its effect on chemical practices.},

The scattering data demonstrate the presence of wormlike micelles, and an analysis based on polymer theory and the results from Monte Carlo simulations was performed. The surfactant concentrations correspond to dilute and semidilute solutions for the wormlike micelles. The analysis of the forward scattering demonstrates a concentration dependence of the growth of the micelles in agreement with mean-field theory. The scattering data in the full range of measured scattering vectors were analyzed using a modified random phase approximation expression, and excellent agreement was found for concentrations up to 65 times the overlap concentration. The model fitting showed that the micelles have an elliptical cross section with semiaxes of about 16 and 28 Angstrom. Based on the self-consistent analysis, an independent comparison between the correlation length determined from the scattering data and from Monte Carlo simulations was performed as a function of the reduced concentration.},

abstract = {We present a critical assessment of the diffusing wave spectroscopy (DWS) technique for obtaining the characteristic lengths and for measuring the loss and storage moduli of a reasonable well-known wormlike micelle (WM) system. For this purpose, we tracked the Brownian motion of particles using DWS embedded in a Maxwellian fluid constituted by a wormlike micellar solution made of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB), sodium salicylate (NaSal), and water. We found that the motion of particles was governed by the viscosity of the solvent at short times and by the stress relaxation mechanisms of the giant micelles at longer times. From the time evolution of the mean square displacement of particles, we could obtain for the WM solution the cage size where each particle is harmonically bound at short times, the long-time diffusion coefficient, and experimental values for the exponent that accounts for the broad spectrum of relaxation times at the plateau onset time found in the (deltar2(t)) vs. time curves. In addition, from the (deltar2(t)) vs. time curves, we obtained G'(omega) and G"(omega) for the WM solutions. All the DWS microreological information allowed us to estimate the characteristic lengths of the WM network. We compare our DWS microrheological results and characteristic lengths with those obtained with mechanical rheometers at different NaSal/CTAB concentration ratios and temperatures.},

abstract = {Co-solvents, such as urea, can entail drastic changes in the micellization behavior of detergents. We present a systematic quantification of the impact of urea on the critical micellar concentration, the micellization thermodynamics, and the micelle size in three homologous series of commonly used non-ionic alkyl detergents. To this end, we performed demicellization experiments by isothermal titration calorimetry and hydrodynamic size measurements by dynamic light scattering on alkyl maltopyranosides, cyclohexyl alkyl maltopyranosides, and alkyl glucopyranosides at urea concentrations of 0-8 M. For all detergents studied, we found that the critical micellar concentration increases exponentially because the absolute Gibbs free energy of micellization decreases linearly over the entire urea concentration range, as does the micelle size. In contrast, the enthalpic and entropic contributions to micellization reveal more complex, nonlinear dependences on urea concentration. Both free energy and size changes are more pronounced for long-chain detergents, which bury more apolar surface area upon micelle formation. The Gibbs free energy increments per methylene group within each detergent series depend on urea concentration in a linear fashion, although they result from the entropic term for alkyl maltosides but are of enthalpic origin for cyclohexyl alkyl maltosides. We compare our results to transfer free energies of amino acid side chains, relate them to protein-folding data, and discuss how urea-induced changes in detergent micelle properties affect in vitro investigations on membrane proteins.},

Experimental data obtained for two worm-like micellar systems indicate that in these solutions, the Cox-Merz rule is not usually followed, in agreement with the predictions of our model.

abstract = {We investigate the temperature effect on the structural and dynamical properties (translation, rotation) of an urea/water system at 0.20 mole fraction of urea. We report the radial distribution functions of like and unlike molecules and conclude that, even at large distances, these molecules are spatially correlated (with respect to their centers of mass). This behavior is interpreted as an indication that urea molecules are not uniformly distributed at a microscopic level. However, the orientational distribution shows that, at long distances, the urea molecules are not orientationally correlated. A strong correlation between urea molecules is observed within the first-shells of neighboring molecules. In view of these results, it is postulated that urea behaves slightly like a nonpolar molecule. The dynamical properties were analyzed using the velocity (translation) and angular velocity (rotation) time autocorrelation functions, as well as their Fourier transforms. The results indicate a significant hydrogen bonding between urea and other molecules in the solution. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

This report extends the number of known polar solvents which can support amphiphile self-assembly by five new amides; more than doubling the number of known amides able to serve as amphiphile self-assembly media. The formation of lyotropic liquid crystalline phases by cationic and non-ionic surfactants in these liquid amides is reported. The ability of a solvent to promote amphiphile self-assembly is governed by the "solvophobic effect" and is linked to the solvent cohesiveness. The Gordon parameter which is a measure of the solvent cohesiveness was found to provide a guide to an amides capacity to support lyotropic liquid crystalline phase diversity and thermal stability ranges of those phases. The "solvophobic effect" and steric hindrance factors were compared between amide's and protic ionic liquids possessing analogous chemical structures and also being able to promote amphiphile self-assembly.},

abstract = {In this work, we investigated in detail the structural characteristics of mixtures of choline chloride and urea with different urea contents by performing molecular dynamic (MD) simulations, and offer possible explanations for the low melting point of the eutectic mixture of choline chloride and urea with a ratio of 1:2. The insertion of urea molecules was found to change the density distribution of cations and anions around the given cations significantly, disrupting the long-range ordered structure of choline chloride. Moreover, with increasing urea concentration, the hydrogen bond interactions between choline cations and Cl(-) anions decreased, while those among urea molecules obviously increased. From the hydrogen bond lifetimes, it was found that a ratio of 1:2 between choline chloride and urea is necessary for a reasonable strength of hydrogen bond interaction to maintain the low melting point of the mixture of choline chloride with urea. In addition, it was also deduced from the interaction energies that a urea content of 67.7 {\%} may make the interactions of cation-anion, cation-urea and anion-urea modest, and thus results in the lower melting point of the eutectic mixture of choline chloride and urea. The present results may offer assistance to some extent for understanding the physicochemical properties of the eutectic mixture of choline chloride and urea, and give valuable information for the further development and application of deep eutectic solvents.},

Both urea and PSML have increased the critical micelle concentration (CMC) of the surfactants, the former being more effective than the latter. The analysis of the results supports the pseudophase micellar model to hold over the mass action model. Pure CTAB micelles bind more counterions (96 {\%}) than pure SDS micelles (87 {\%}), and the decreasing effect of urea on the binding is less in case of the former than the latter. A 4:1 mixture of CTAB and sodium cholate (NaC) can micellize and the micelles bind 87 {\%} bromide ion, whereas 2:1 and 1:1 mixtures do not micellize. Micelles of 1:1 mixture of CTAB and NaCl can bind counter bromide ions to the extent of 92 {\%}. The limiting concentrations of urea required to effect counterion binding by CTAB and SDS micelles are 0.15 mol dm -3  and 0.25 mol dm -3 , respectively. Such effect is shown by PSML on CTAB at a ratio 0.28:1. The activation energy of conduction of SDS has increased in the presence of urea up to a concentration of 4 mol dm -3 , at higher concentrations the activation energy has decreased, the effect being more for surfactant concentration above CMC than below. {\textcopyright} 1989 Steinkopff.},

The analysis of the data showed that the surfactant under these conditions forms short stiff cylindrical micelles. The surfactant concentration ranges from 2 times the critical micelle concentration to well above the overlap concentration of the cylindrical micelles. A self-consistent approach was used for analyzing the SANS and SLS data simultaneously. The forward scattering was determined from the scattering at low scattering vectors, and from this, the apparent molar mass of the micelles was derived. It was fitted by a model with a power-law growth law combined with a term which describes intermicellar interaction effects. The length of the micelles was derived from the growth law using the mass per unit length as determined from the scattering data at high scattering vectors. Finally, the data in the full range of measured scattering vectors were fitted for all concentrations by a model based on the polymer reference interaction site model with a simple ansatz for the direct correlation function. The variations of the parameters of the micelles as obtained in the analysis were compared to the parameters for solutions of half-ionized TDAO for which semiflexible micelles are formed.},

abstract = {In isothermal titration calorimetry, the statistical precisions with which the equilibrium constant (K) and reaction enthalpy (DeltaH degrees ) can be estimated from data for 1:1 binding depend on a number of quantities, key among them being the products c identical with K[M](0) and h identical with DeltaH degrees [M](0), the stoichiometry range (R(m)(), ratio of total titrant X to total titrate M after the last injection), and the number of injections of titrant. A study of the statistical errors as functions of these quantities leads to the following prescription for optimizing throughput and precision: (1) Make 10 injections of titrant. (2) Set the concentrations in accord with the empirical equation R(m)() = 6.4/c(0.2) + 13/c (but no smaller than 1.1). (3) Make the starting concentration [M](0) as large as possible within the large-signal limits of the instrumentation but limited to c {\textless} 10(3) for estimating K. With this procedure, both K and [M](0) are predicted to have relative standard errors {\textless}1{\%} over large ranges of K. Systematic errors in the concentrations, [X](0) and [M](0), are fully compensated by the "site number" or stoichiometry parameter (n). On the other hand, altering and freezing any of the fit parameters leads to a deterioration of the fit quality and to predictable changes in the other parameters. Fit divergence at very small c is avoidable through a simple redefinition of the fit parameters; however, unless n can be fixed from other information, DeltaH degrees may be statistically ill-defined in this region.},

abstract = {We have used two different force field models to study concentrated dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)–water solutions by molecular dynamics. The results of these simulations are shown to compare well with recent neutron diffraction experiments using H/D isotope substitution [A. K. Soper and A. Luzar, J. Chem. Phys. 97, 1320 (1992)]. Even for the highly concentrated 1 DMSO : 2 H2O solution, the water hydrogen–hydrogen radial distribution function, gHH(r), exhibits the characteristic tetrahedral ordering of water–water hydrogen bonds. Structural information is further obtained from various partial atom–atom distribution functions, not accessible experimentally. The behavior of water radial distribution functions, gOO(r) and gOH(r) indicate that the nearest neighbor correlations among remaining water molecules in the mixture increase with increasing DMSO concentration. No preferential association of methyl groups on DMSO is detected. The pattern of hydrogen bonding and the distribution of hydrogen bond lifetimes in the simulated mixtures is further investigated. Molecular dynamics results show that DMSO typically forms two hydrogen bonds with water molecules. Hydrogen bonds between DMSO and water molecules are longer lived than water–water hydrogen bonds. The hydrogen bond lifetimes determined by reactive flux correlation function approach are about 5 and 3 ps for water–DMSO and water–water pairs, respectively, in 1 DMSO : 2 H2O mixture. In contrast, for pure water, the hydrogen bond lifetime is about 1 ps. We discuss these times in light of experimentally determined rotational relaxation times. The relative values of the hydrogen bond lifetimes are consistent with a statistical (i.e., transition state theory) interpretation.},

abstract = {Here we report micellar and micellization characteristics of single and mixed Tetronics{\textregistered} altered by the presence of urea using high sensitivity differential scanning calorimetry (HSDSC) and small angle neutron scattering (SANS). Three Tetronics{\textregistered} with almost identical polypropylene oxide (PPO) blocks but variable polyethylene oxide (PEO) blocks viz. T1301, T1304 and T1307, were chosen for studying their solution behavior in aqueous urea (0-8 M) solutions. In the case of single micellar systems, the three copolymers showed markedly different behavior.T1301 being most hydrophobic forms vesicular structures at ambient temperature, T1304 with moderate hydrophobicity forms micelles with low polydispersity while very hydrophilic T1307 exhibits high polydispersity and occur as unimers, loose micelles and clusters. The addition of urea has a disruptive effect on all the three copolymers; smaller vesicles in T1301, smaller micelles with enhanced polydispersity in T1304 and T1307 completely demicellizes to unimers and clusters as evidenced by SANS. A similar trend has also been noticed for mixed micelles. However, the phase separation temperature/critical micelle temperature (CMT) of the copolymers in binary mixtures are slightly lower as compared to the copolymer solutions of individual block copolymers in the presence of 8 M urea. HSDSC measurements revealed decreased enthalpy of micellization (∆ H) and increased CMT in the presence of urea suggesting enhanced solubility of the copolymer and consequently delayed micellization.},

abstract = {It is generally thought that the impact of surfaces on the contiguous aqueous phase extends to a distance of no more than a few water-molecule layers. Older studies, on the other hand, suggest a more extensive impact. We report here that colloidal and molecular solutes suspended in aqueous solution are profoundly and extensively excluded from the vicinity of various hydrophilic surfaces. The width of the solute-free zone is typically several hundred microns. Such large exclusion zones were observed in the vicinity of many types of surface including artificial and natural hydrogels, biological tissues, hydrophilic polymers, monolayers, and ion-exchange beads, as well as with a variety of solutes. Using microscopic observations, as well as measurements of electrical potential and UV-Vis absorption-spectra, infrared imaging, and NMR imaging, we find that the solute-free zone is a physically distinct and less mobile phase of water that can co-exist indefinitely with the contiguous solute-containing phase. The extensiveness of this modified zone is impressive, and carries broad implication for surface-molecule interactions in many realms, including cellular recognition, biomaterial-surface antifouling, bioseparation technologies, and other areas of biology, physics and chemistry. {\textcopyright} 2006.},

Viscous solutions having almost maximum zero-shear viscosity showed non-Newtonian behavior and had Maxwell-type mechanical properties. When a small fraction of LA of the water/C16SE/LA system was substituted with sodium laurate (SL), the maximum zero-shear viscosity increased by nearly one order of magnitude from the original system due to a decrease in the diffusion constant of the wormlike micelles. With further substitutions of LA with SL, the zero-shear viscosity decreased because the highly hydrophilic fatty acid soap makes elongated micelles shorter. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

We show that upon increasing the amount of absorbed hydrocarbon the rheological behavior of semidilute micellar solutions changes drastically, showing a sequence of different regimes: (i) a "fast-breaking" entangled regime, when very long micellar chains form a network; (ii) an "unbreakable" entangled regime, when the shortening of the micelles leads to the decrease of their reptation time up to the values close to the breaking time; (iii) an unentangled regime (for the first time evidenced for wormlike micelles), where the micelles are so short that they cannot interlace. Within the entangled regime, an unusual rheological behavior has been discovered, probably characterized by the dominant role of end or bond interchange reactions or "breathing" modes, which leads to a novel hypothesis that hydrocarbon is distributed nonuniformly along the micellar length, thus increasing the probability of micellar breakage at certain points.},

abstract = {Pyrene solubulization and NMR spectroscopy were employed to study the competition between two surfactant aggregation processes in aqueous polymer/organic salt/surfactant systems. Two organic salts used in the study are tetrabutylammonium bromide (Bu4NBr) and tetrapropylammonium bromide (Pr4NBr). The anionic surfactant sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) is known to have moderate interactions with poly(N-vinylpyrrolidone) (PVP), which results in the formation of a PVP–SDS aggregation complex. On the other hand, SDS also can associate with tetraalkylammonium bromides (TAABs) to form mixed micelles by a strong electrostatic attraction. The pyrene solubilization experiments reveal that the dominant aggregation in PVP/TAAB/SDS systems is determined by the [SDS]/[TAAB] ratio, and complexation of PVP with SDS does not occur until the [SDS]/[TAAB] ratio is larger than a specific ratio. For example, when [SDS]/[Bu4NBr] is less than 1.1, only Bu4N+–SDS mixed micelles are formed, and the mixed micelles do not associate with PVP. When [SDS]/[Bu4NBr] is higher than 1.1, polymer-induced SDS aggregation is detected along with the mixed micellization between SDS and Bu4NBr. More interestingly, the Bu4N+ ions do incorporate with the PVP-bound SDS aggregate to form a PVP–(Bu4N+–SDS) complex. By means of 2D NOESY and PFG NMR experiments, both structural and dynamic aspects of the aggregate species formed in the PVP/TAAB/SDS solution were studied. An interaction model was proposed to manifest the role of the two TAAB salts for PVP–SDS complexation in the PVP/TAAB/SDS systems.},

abstract = {Aims Steroidal and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are used for treatment of peripheral inflammation, but they are not effective in neurodegenerative disorders. Gold compounds are also used to treat peripheral inflammation, but their effects on neuroimmune reactions are unknown. This study investigated the effects of gold compounds on astrocytic cell functions and assessed in vivo distribution of auranofin after its oral administration in mice. Main methods Auranofin and three other gold compounds were investigated for their ability to reduce the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines and cytotoxins produced by activated human astrocytic cells. Ability of the gold compounds to protect neuronal cells from glial cytotoxins and from oxidative damage induced by hydrogen peroxide was also studied. The in vivo distribution of auranofin was investigated using laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS). Key findings Auranofin (0.1-5 $\mu$M) inhibited the toxicity of stimulated primary human astrocytes and U-373 MG astrocytic cells towards human neuronal cells, but did not inhibit secretion of cytokines. Treatment of neuronal cells with high nanomolar to low micromolar concentrations of auranofin protected them from toxicity induced by hydrogen peroxide and supernatants of stimulated astrocytic cells through the upregulation of heme-oxygenase (HOX)-1. Aurothiomalate, aurothioglucose, and aurothiosulphate were ineffective in the assays used. Auranofin reached low micromolar concentrations in mouse brains following daily oral administration for one week. Significance Since auranofin may protect neurons by inhibiting astrocyte toxicity and is also directly neuroprotective, it could be useful in neurodegenerative diseases where activation of astrocytes contributes to the neuronal loss. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

The PHPMA provided to the self-assembled nanoparticle stability against aggregation as evaluated in vitro. The highly hydrophobic drug docetaxel (DTXL) was physically entrapped within the PBS/PBDL copolyester core and the hydrophilic drug doxorubicin hydrochloride (DOX{\textperiodcentered}HCl) was chemically conjugated to the reactive PHPMA copolymer shell via hydrazone bonding that allowed its pH-sensitive release. This strategy enabled the combination chemotherapy by the simultaneous DOX and DTXL drug delivery. The structure of the nanoparticles was characterized in detail using static (SLS), dynamic (DLS) and electrophoretic (ELS) light scattering besides transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The use of nanoparticles simultaneously loaded with DTXL and DOX provided a more efficient suppression of tumor-cell growth in mice bearing EL-4 T cell lymphoma when compared to the effect of nanoparticles loaded with either DTXL or DOX separately.

abstract = {Sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) in 0.8 M NaCl in D2O has been studied by small-angle neutron scattering (SANS), dynamic light scattering (DLS), and time-resolved fluorescence quenching (TRFQ) measurements in the concentration range from 10 to 80 mM and at temperatures from 25 to 45°C. Examination by cryo-transmission electron microscopy revealed the presence of a variety of structures, from broad band-like or lace-like aggregates to multiconnected threads. It is suggested that these structures are formed at the air-solution interface. To verify that they are not present in the bulk solution, SANS, DLS, and TRFQ were studied on the same solutions. The SANS results confirm, on the length scale available using this technique, a local cylindrical structure for the micelles. Assuming a rod model, with the slow mode corresponding to translational diffusion and the fast mode to the rotational dynamics of cylindrical SDS micelles, the DLS data at 25°C in 0.8 M NaCl would correspond to a hydrodynamic length L ≃ 150 nm, employing a radius of about 2 nm. The TRFQ shows a transition from small micelles at high temperature and low surfactant concentration to long structures at low temperature and high concentration.},

abstract = {Clay minerals are natural or synthetic material of colloidal dimensions. Due to the sheetlike structure clay minerals offer a huge specific surface area and hence optimal properties for modification through adsorption. The current work studies the adsorption of five cationic dyes on the synthetic clay mineral hectorite. All dyes have a trimethylammonium anchoring group in common. The adsorbed dye molecules are characterized by means of pulsed electric linear dichroism and UV-VIS spectroscopy. With increasing dye loading a continuous shift in the absorption spectra is observed. But there is no occurrence of a new absorption band. Therefore we conclude that the dyes preferentially adsorb as amorphous aggregates on the clay surface. At low dye loadings the dye molecules lie flat on the clay mineral surface. Increasing dye concentration leads to a continuous increase in average tilt angle. However the orientation of the dye molecules is very sensitive to functional groups. The introduction of a nitro group to a particular dye increases significantly the tendency to lie flat on the surface whereas the introduction of a methoxy group at the same position has the opposite effect. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science.},

The viscoelastic changes were confirmed to be reversible with respect to a pH change. The times required for the solutions to recover the behavior at R) 0.5 after the addition of HCl to the solutions of R) 0 were about 25 h at 0.05 mol (kg water)-1 and 14 days at 0.15 mol (kg water)-1. The correspondence between the viscoelastic properties and the cryoTEM observations was good. It was suggested from the viscoelastic properties that the threadlike micelles grew with R at R) 0.2, but the change from threadlike micelles to vesicles was suggested as R increased further. On increasing the concentration atR)0.5, the vesicles became perforated, probably due to the increased counterion concentration. The present results indicate unambiguously the important and effective action of protonation in controlling the packing parameter, or the mean curvature, of amine oxide amphiphiles.},

abstract = {Alkylimidazolium salts are a very important class of compounds. So far, calorimetry has hardly been used to characterize their solution behaviour. The enthalpies obtained from indirect methods have an intrinsic large uncertainty, and nowadays it is clear that calorimetry is the most sensitive technique for directly measuring the thermodynamic properties of aggregation. In this work, isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) was used along with conductivity to determine the thermodynamics of aggregation of 1-alkyl-3-methylimidazolium chlorides ([Cnmim]Cl, n = 8, 10, 12, and 14) in aqueous solution. The critical micelle concentrations, cmc, were obtained from conductivity and calorimetry, and the enthalpies of micelle formation, $\Delta$Hmic, were derived from the calorimetric titrations. From conductivity, we could also derive the values for the degree of ionisation of the micelles ($\alpha$), the molar conductivity ($\Lambda$M) of the [Cnmim]Cl micellar species and the molar conductivity at infinite dilution ($\Lambda$∞) for the [Cnmim]+cations. Values are therefore reported for the enthalpy ($\Delta$Hmic), the Gibbs free energy ($\Delta$Gmic) and entropy ($\Delta$Smic) changes for micelle formation. Further, the aggregate sizes and aggregation numbers were obtained by light scattering (LS) measurements. The observed variation of the thermodynamic properties with the alkyl chain length is discussed in detail and compared with the traditional cationic surfactants 1-alkyl-trimethylammonium chlorides, [CnTA]Cl. The difference in the values of the thermodynamic parameters for both types of surfactants is here related to the structure of their head groups. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {A series of cationic calix[4]arene-based lipids with alkyl chains of varying length were newly synthesized, and the ones with propyl and hexyl tails, denoted by CaL[4]C3 and C6, respectively, were found to form spherical micelles at low pH (protonated state of the amine headgroup). Upon deprotonation with increasing pH, CaL[4]C3 showed a sphere-to-cylinder transition, while CaL[4]C6 changed from sphere, to cylinder, to monolayer vesicle. Synchrotron small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) patterns from both spherical and cylindrical CaL[4]C3 micelles exhibited a sharp intensity minimum, indicating shape monodispersity. The monodispersity of the CaL[4]C3 spherical micelles was further confirmed by analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC). SAXS, AUC, and static light scattering agreeingly indicated an aggregation number of 6. In contrast, CaL[4]C6 exhibited polydispersity with an average aggregation number of 12. When the number of carbons of the alkyl chain was increased to 9 (CaL[4]C9), cylinder formed at low pH, while at high pH, no clear morphology could be observed. The present results indicate that a very precise combination of tail length, head volume, and rigidity of the building block is required to produce shape-persistent micelles and that the shape-persistence can be maintained upon a structural transition. An attempt to reconstruct a molecular model for the spherical CaL[4]C3 micelle was made with an ab initio shape determining program.},

Stimuli-responsive viscoelastic gels of long wormlike micelles are formed at low surfactant concentrations in the presence of neutral naphthols, where H-bonding plays a key role in micellar shape transition in the absence of any charge screening. Micelle-embedded naphthols also act as novel self-fluorescence probes for monitoring viscoelasticity of the system as a function of applied shear. 1H NMR study shows that the solubilization sites of naphthols in the micelle are located near the surface. While UV absorption and Fourier transform infrared studies confirm the presence of intermolecular H-bonds in micelle embedded naphthols, transmission electron micrographs of vacuum-dried samples at room temperature demonstrate the transition in shape from sphere to rodlike micelles.},

abstract = {The micellar system composed of Cetylpyridinium Chloride-Sodium Salicylate (CPyCl-NaSal) in brine aqueous solutions has been studied by systematically changing the salt concentration, in order to investigate the rheology of the arising morphologies. In particular, the zero-shear viscosity and the linear viscoelastic response have been measured as a function of the NaSal concentration (with [CPyCl] = 100 mM). The Newtonian viscosity shows a nonmonotonic dependence upon concentration, passing through a maximum at NaSal/CPyCl approximate to 0.6, and eventually dropping at higher salt concentrations. The progressive addition of salt determines first a transition from a Newtonian to a purely Maxwell-like behavior as the length of the micelles significantly increases. Beyond the peak viscosity, the viscoelastic data show two distinct features. On the one hand, the main relaxation time of the system strongly decreases, while the plateau modulus remains essentially constant. Calculations based on the rheological data show that, as the binding salt concentration increases, there is a decrease in micelles breaking rate and a decrease in their average length. On the other hand, in the same concentration region, a low-frequency elastic plateau is measured. Such a plateau is considered as the signature of a tenuous, but persistent branched network, whose existence is confirmed by cryo-transmission electron microscopy images.

Small changes in the thermodynamic and volumetric parameters (e.g., the partial volume change is approximately +2 per thousand) are discussed in detail as the result of three effects governing the transition.

abstract = {In this work, the effect of some Hofmeister anions on the Krafft temperature (T K) and micelle formation of cetylpyridinium bromide (CPB) have been studied. The results show that more chaotropic anions increase, while the less chaotropic ones lower the T K of the surfactant. More chaotropic I− and SCN− form contact ion pairs with the cetylpyridinium ion and reduce the electrostatic repulsion between the CPB molecules. As a result, these ions show salting-out behavior, with a consequent increase in the T K. In contrast, less chaotropic Cl− and NO3 − increase the activity of free water molecules and enhance hydration of CPB molecules, showing a decrease in the T K. A rather unusual behavior was observed in the case of SO4 2− and F−. These strong kosmotropes shift from their usual position in the Hofmeister series and behave like moderate chaotropes, lowering the T K of the surfactant. Because of the high charge density and the strong tendency for hydration these ions preferentially remain in the bulk. Rather than forming contact ion pairs, these ions stay away from the CPB molecules, decreasing the T K of the surfactant. In term of decreasing the T K, the ions follow the order NO3 − {\{}{\textgreater}{\}} SO4 2− {\{}{\textgreater}{\}} Cl− {\{}{\textgreater}{\}} F− {\{}{\textgreater}{\}} Br− {\{}{\textgreater}{\}} SCN− {\{}{\textgreater}{\}} I−.

abstract = {Current antiretroviral therapy (ART) provides potent suppression of HIV-1 replication. However, ART does not target latent viral reservoirs, so persistent infection remains a challenge. Small molecules with pharmacological properties that allow them to reach and activate viral reservoirs could potentially be utilized to eliminate the latent arm of the infection when used in combination with ART. Here we describe a cell-based system modeling HIV-1 latency that was utilized in a high-throughput screen to identify small molecule antagonists of HIV-1 latency. A more detailed analysis is provided for one of the hit compounds, antiviral 6 (AV6), which required nuclear factor of activated T cells for early mRNA expression while exhibiting RNA-stabilizing activity. It was found that AV6 reproducibly activated latent provirus from different lymphocyte-based clonal cell lines as well as from latently infected primary resting CD4(+) T cells without causing general T cell proliferation or activation. Moreover, AV6 complemented the latency antagonist activity of a previously described histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor. This is a proof of concept showing that a high-throughput screen employing a cell-based model of HIV-1 latency can be utilized to identify new classes of compounds that can be used in concert with other persistent antagonists with the aim of viral clearance.},

abstract = {Stress relaxation in worm-like micelles and other "living polymers" is governed by an interplay between simple reptation and intermicelle reactions.  A simple model of stress relaxation is used in which the linear viscoelastic functions can be written as averages over a certain one-dimensional stochastic process.  A detailed numerical study was recently made for the case when scission and end to end recombination reactions are present (Turner M. S. and Cates M. E., Langmuir 7 (1991) 1590).  In the present work we use the same approach to study other reaction mechanisms.  We consider both end-interchange, where the end of one chain "bites" into the sequence of another, and bond-interchange, where chains exchange material by formation of a fourfold-coordinated intermediate.  We find that end-interchange results in quantitatively similar viscoelastic behaviour to the reversible scission case:  for tau(break) less-than-or-similar-to tau(rep) the terminal time-tau is much reduced from the reptation value and the spectrum becomes monoexponential with tau approximately tau(break)1/2 tau(rep)1/2.  Here tau(rep) is the reptation time of a hypothetical unbreakable chain of the average length, and tau(break) a suitably defined micellar scission time.  For the case of bond-interchange we predict qualitatively similar behaviour, although the terminal time-tau is less strongly affected than for the other two reaction schemes; in the regime tau(break) {\textless}{\textless} tau(rep) we predict-tau approximately tau(break)1/3 tau(rep)2/3.  This result is also confirmed in the numerical study.  Finally we include an idealised treatment of constraint release which suggests that the effect of tube renewal on stress relaxation is relatively weak in these systems.  We use the Cole-Cole representation of the frequency-dependent modulus G*(omega), which provides a sensitive method of probing the relaxation.  Comparison of our calculated plots with experimental viscoelastic data may provide, in principle, a method for determining the reaction mechanisms present in any given system.},

abstract = {Unilamellar vesicles are observed to form in aqueous solutions of the cationic surfactant, cetyl trimethylammonium bromide (CTAB), when 5-methyl salicylic acid (5mS) is added at slightly larger than equimolar concentrations. When these vesicles are heated above a critical temperature, they transform into long, flexible wormlike micelles. In this process, the solutions switch from low-viscosity, Newtonian fluids to viscoelastic, shear-thinning fluids having much larger zero-shear viscosities (e.g., 1000-fold higher). The onset temperature for this transition increases with the concentration of 5mS at a fixed CTAB content. Small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) measurements show that the phase transition from vesicles to micelles is a continuous one, with the vesicles and micelles coexisting over a narrow range of temperatures. The tunable vesicle-to-micelle transition and the concomitant viscosity increase upon heating may have utility in a range of areas, including microfluidics, controlled release, and tertiary oil recovery.},

The appearance of cross peaks between the protons of SDS and those of TX- 100 in the 2D NOESY map is direct evidence for the solubilization of the hydrocarbon chains of SDS inside the TX-100 micelles that have nonextended hydrocarbon chains. The effect of the aromatic ring currents of TX-100 on the protons of the methylene groups, which are nearest to the polar head of SDS, indicates the near vicinity of these groups. The existence of the cross peaks between the hydrophilic protons and the remote hydrophobic protons of TX-100 suggests that the hydrophilic chains are not extended in the mixed micelles.1H spin-lattice relaxation time (T1) and spin-spin relaxation time (T2) measurements support the results obtained by the 2D NOESY experiments. {\textcopyright} 2001 Academic Press.},

abstract = {Polymer solutions in the vicinity of the theta-point are known to undergo shear-induced turbidity or phase separation. The present study shows that a similar phenomenon also occurs for certain wormlike micellar solutions. Wormlike micelles are the self-assembled counterparts of polymers and are characterized by their ability to reversibly break and recombine. In the system of interest, the micelles are formed by the cationic surfactant erucyl bis(hydroxyethyl)methylammonium chloride (EHAC), in conjunction with a salt such as sodium chloride (NaCl) or sodium salicylate (NaSal). Micellar samples that become turbid under shear show evidence of critical concentration fluctuations and may contain predominantly branched micelles. The shear-induced turbidity in these samples correlates with the appearance of flow-dichroism in rheooptic experiments and with an increase in low-q scattering in small-angle light scattering under flow (flow-SALS) experiments. The characteristic "butterfly" pattern, with enhanced scattering in the flow direction and a dark streak perpendicular to the flow direction, is typically observed in flow-SALS. The results suggest that the turbidity is due to a shear-induced growth of concentration fluctuations, which in turn manifests as large anisotropic domains, typically oriented along the vorticity axis.},

@article{Vogtt2017a,
abstract = {Wormlike micelles (WLMs) are nanoscale, self-assembled components of many products from shampoos to fracking fluids due to their viscoelasticity. Their rheological behavior is largely governed by the contour length of the micelles and the concomitant propensity of the micelles to overlap and entangle. The large contour lengths, on the order of micrometers, is the result of a delicate balance between the scission enthalpy of the wormlike micelles on the one hand and entropic factors such as the mixing entropy of dispersion, the ordering of water molecules and counterions, and the mobility of branch points on the other hand. The structure and contour length of wormlike micelles assembled from sodium laureth-1-sulfate was determined at various temperatures using small-angle neutron scattering. The results allow the calculation of the enthalpy and entropy as well as the free energy of scission and are employed to critically evaluate the common methods to determine micellar scission energy from mean-field theory. Interesting behavior is observed when comparing branched and unbranched WLMs that may reflect on mechanistic differences in chain scission.},

abstract = {The rheology of wormlike micelles ("worms") formed by surfactants in water often follows nonmonotonic trends as functions of composition. For example, a study by Raghavan et al. (Langmuir 2002, 18, 3797) on mixtures of the anionic surfactant sodium oleate (NaOA) and the cationic surfactant octyl trimethylammonium bromide (OTAB) reported a pronounced peak in the zero-shear viscosity eta0 as a function of NaOA/OTAB ratio at a constant surfactant concentration (3 wt {\%}). In this work, we study the origins of rheological changes in the NaOA/OTAB system and the relations between the composition and structural characteristics using cryo-transmission electron microscopy (cryo-TEM). When either surfactant is in large excess, the dominating morphology is that of spherical micelles. As oppositely charged surfactant is added to the mixture, the spheres grow into linear worms and these continue to elongate as the viscosity peak (which occurs at a 70/30 NaOA/OTAB ratio) is approached from either end. At the viscosity peak, the sample shows numerous long worms as well as a small number of branched worms. Taken together, NaOA/OTAB rheology can be primarily understood on the basis of micellar growth, which is explained primarily by packing arguments. While the size of the hydrophobic micellar core continuously decreases as the short amphiphile OTAB is added at the expense of NaOA, screening of charges goes through a maximum, which contributes to the asymmetry of the viscosity curve. With regard to micellar branching, there is no significant difference in the density of branched worms on either side of the viscosity peak. Therefore, it appears that in contrast to the behavior of some surfactant/salt systems, branching does not have a significant influence on the rheology of this mixed catanionic surfactant system. Instead, our data clearly indicate that the origin of the viscosity peak is linked with micellar growth and micellar shortening.},

Critical micellization concentration (cmc) and temperature (cmt) values for the amphiphilic block copolymer dissolved in urea/water mixtures (urea concentration 0, 1, 2, and 4 M) were obtained using a dye solubilization method and corroborated with data from surface tension, density, and fluorescence spectroscopy experiments. Urea increased the cmc and cmt of the PEO-PPO-PEO copolymer; the effect of urea on the cmt was more pronounced at low copolymer concentrations and diminished at concentrations of similar to 2.5{\%}. The thermodynamic parameters of micelle formation in the presence of urea were estimated using a closed association model; the enthalpy of micellization was positive (endothermic) and decreased upon increasing the urea concentration. The surface activity and the partial specific volume of the block copolymer decreased with an increase in the urea concentration, whereas the hydrodynamic radii of the copolymer micelles, determined using dynamic light scattering, remained unaffected by the presence of 4 M urea in the solution. The micropolarity in copolymer solutions in urea/water was probed as a function of temperature using the I-1/I-3 intensity ratio of the pyrene vibrational fine structure recorded in fluorescence emission spectra; a small decrease in the micropolarity of the micelle core was observed in the presence of urea. The microviscosity in the micelle interior, estimated from the intramolecular excimer fluorescence of the hydrophobic probe bis(1-pyrenylmethyl) ether (dipyme), also exhibited a small decrease with an increase in the urea concentration. The findings presented here are discussed in the context of the molecular mechanism underlying the effects of urea.},

The titration process is followed by means of calorimetric measurements and by determining the pH values as a function of added base. This approach yields a complete thermodynamic description of the titration process. In particular, we find that the process is endothermic at 298 K. This is contrary to the titration of carboxylic acids in water, where DeltaH is approximately 0. To identify the main effect underlying the difference in DeltaH between titration in a micelle and water, a thermodynamic model has been developed which focuses on the transfer properties of charged and uncharged species from bulk water to the surface of a micelle and which incorporates a dielectric discontinuity at the micellar surface. The model relies on the use of the Poisson-Boltzmann equation which is solved using a finite element method. Experimental results and the model calculations imply that the dielectric discontinuity at (or near) the micellar surface plays a major role and hence must be included when analyzing the titration behavior of an acid functionality at the surface of a charged micelle.},

Despite their extensive use, there are still many details about the microscopic micellar structure and the mechanisms by which wormlike micelles form under flow that are not clearly understood. Microfluidic devices provide a versatile platform to study wormlike micellar solutions under various flow conditions and confined geometries. A review of recent investigations using microfluidics to study the flow of wormlike micelles is presented here with an emphasis on three different flow types: shear, elongation, and complex flow fields. In particular, we focus on the use of shear flows to study shear banding, elastic instabilities of wormlike micellar solutions in extensional flow (including stagnation and contraction flow field), and the use of contraction geometries to measure the elongational viscosity of wormlike micellar solutions. Finally, we showcase the use of complex flow fields in microfluidics to generate a stable and nanoporous flow-induced structured phase (FISP) from wormlike micellar solutions. This review shows that the influence of spatial confinement and moderate hydrodynamic forces present in the microfluidic device can give rise to a host of possibilities of microstructural rearrangements and interesting flow phenomena. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Dielectric spectroscopy measurements for aqueous urea solutions were performed at 298 K through a concentration range from 0.5 to 9.0 M with frequencies between 200 MHz and 40 GHz. Observed dielectric spectra were well represented by the superposition of two Debye type relaxation processes attributable to the bulk-water clusters and the urea-water coclusters. Our quantitative analysis of the spectra shows that the number of hydration water molecules is approximately two per urea molecule for the lower concentration region below 5.0 M, while the previous molecular dynamics studies predicted approximately six water molecules. It was also indicated by those studies, however, that there are two types of hydration water molecule in urea solution, which are strongly and weakly associated to the urea molecule, respectively. Only the strongly associated water was distinguishable in our analysis, while the weakly associated water exhibited the same dynamic feature as bulk water. This implies that urea retains the weakly associated water in the tetrahedral structure and, thus, is not a strong structure breaker of water. We also verified the model of liquid water where water consists of two states: the icelike-ordered and dense-disordered phases. Our dielectric data did not agree with the theoretical prediction based on the two-phase model. The present work supports the argument that urea molecules can easily replace near-neighbor water in the hydrogen-bonding network and do not require the presence of the disordered phase of water to dissolve into water.},

abstract = {We have investigated the uniaxial elongation behavior of six different wormlike micelle systems covering a broad range of surfactant concentrations and salt/surfactant ratios R using the capillary breakup elongational rheometry (CaBER). In the fast-breaking limit (high and R), filament lifetime is controlled by the equilibrium shear modulus G0 and the breakage time obtained from small oscillatory shear according to and relaxation time ratios are found. When reptation dominates (high , low R) is observed similar as for solutions of covalently bound polymers. In this concentration regime, the micellar structure seems not to be affected by the strong elongational flow. In contrast, high filament lifetimes up to 1000 s and values up to 10 are observed at low irrespective of R. This indicates the formation of elongation-induced structures (EISs). A minimum viscosity and a minimum initial diameter are required for creating EIS. Additional filament stretching experiments indicate that a critical total deformation has to be exceeded for structure build-up. Finally, our experiments reveal a distinct difference regarding the dependence between solutions of linear and branched micelles of filament lifetime on viscosity suggesting that CaBER is a versatile means to distinguish between these structures. c s c s t f i l $\lambda$ b r t f i l / G 0 ∝ $\lambda$ b r 2 / 3 $\lambda$ e / $\lambda$ s ≈ 1 c s $\lambda$ e / $\lambda$ s 1 $\lambda$ e / $\lambda$ s c s},

abstract = {Recently there has been a great deal of attention, from researchers both in academia and in industry, focused on the rheological properties of solutions of viscoelastic wormlike micelles formed by surfactants. It is particularly vital to understand the properties of these solutions with regard to their flow in porous media, given their application to the recovery of hydrocarbons from subterranean formations. In this study a realistic mesoscopic Brownian dynamics model has been utilized to investigate the flow of viscoelastic surfactant (VES) fluid through individual pores with sizes of around one micron. In particular the influence of micelle size, pore geometry and flow rate on the ability of worms to pass through the pores was studied. The ways in which these parameters influence the conformational properties of the worms and the spatial distribution of micelles inside the simulation cell was also investigated. Despite the observation that the density and length distributions became non-uniform at higher scission energy, the distribution of breaking and fusion events remained spatially uniform.},

@article{Adao2012a,
abstract = {The use of a good chemical calibration or test reaction in Isothermal Titration Calorimetry is crucial for getting reliable enthalpy values that can be compared across different laboratories. Indeed most titration calorimeters are used to measure both equilibrium constants and molar enthalpies of reaction. But a necessary prerequisite for such measurements is to first perform the enthalpy measurement accurately and precisely. The values of the equilibrium constant(s) are then calculated by regression from an appropriate model. As such, we found it timely to extensively test a previously proposed test reaction, the dilution of propan-1-ol into water, using two calorimeters of different design (heat conduction and power compensation calorimeters) and sensitivity. Experiments were performed at 298.15 K for the previously suggested 10{\%} mass fraction propan-1-ol solution, as well as for the lower concentrations of 5{\%} and 2{\%} mass fractions. Due to our capacity to use insertion heaters with one of the used calorimeters, which allows for very accurate calibration constants to be obtained, we also determined a value for the enthalpy of dilution of 10{\%} mass fraction solution at 308.15 K, previously not available, and closer to the temperatures commonly used in titration experiments involving biological samples. The observed change in the enthalpy of dilution was found to decrease in absolute value, but to an extent that did not justify the determination of new values for the less concentrated solutions. The values obtained with the two calorimeters are in excellent agreement, as well as with the values from the literature for the 10{\%} mass fraction solution at 298.15 K. This reaction is thus again proposed as an excellent test reaction and the detailed conditions of their use depending on instrument sensitivity are suggested. In summary, the values for the enthalpies of dilution to infinite dilution $\Delta$dilHm at 298.15 K are -(1.540 ± 0.021) kJ{\textperiodcentered}mol-1, -(0.604 ± 0.020) kJ{\textperiodcentered}mol-1, and -(0.186 ± 0.011) kJ{\textperiodcentered}mol-1for the 10{\%}, 5{\%}, and 2{\%} mass fraction solutions, respectively, and at 308.15 K -(1.486 ± 0.017) kJ{\textperiodcentered}mol-1for the 10{\%} mass fraction solution. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The values of$\Delta$miccp are negative for all surfactants in all solvents relating to the removal of water accessible non-polar surfaces also in the presence of excess counterions.

Especially for mixed surfactant systems, the micelles can take a very wide range of structures, depending on the surfactant packing parameter and other thermodynamic conditions. Synchrotron-based small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) in combination with fast mixing using a stopped-flow apparatus can give direct access to the structural kinetics on a millisecond time scale. Here, this approach is used to study the formation of cylindrical micelles after mixing two solutions with globular micelles of the nonionic surfactant dodecyl maltoside (DDM) and the anionic surfactant sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), respectively.

The properties and structures of the aggregates, formed at a concentration ratio equal to 2:1 ([C16mimBr]:[AzoCOONa]), were comprehensively characterized by rheometer and cryogenic transmission electron microscopy. Initially, viscoelastic wormlike micelles with a viscosity of 0.65 Pa{\textperiodcentered}s were constructed in the C16mimBr/AzoCOONa system. Upon irradiation by UV light (365 nm), particularly fascinating is that the wormlike micelles become much longer and more entangled, exhibiting a high viscosity of 6.9 Pa{\textperiodcentered}s. This can be attributed to photoisomerization of the AzoCOONa molecule from trans to cis form. It is the first time that, with exposure to UV or visible light, the aggregate type of the photoresponsive system has remained unchanged, with only a change of internal property parameters. The cation−$\pi$ interaction prevailing over the hydrophobic interaction and electrostatic interaction between C16mimBr and AzoCOONa molecules is supposed to be responsible for this peculiar phase behavior. The wormlike micelles constructed with the SAIL and photosensitive additive exhibit controllable viscoelastic behavior in the photoresponsive process. In addition, the average contour length of wormlike micelles was found to slightly decrease with the increase of temperature. We expect this system will receive particular attention due to its unique properties and potential applications in drug delivery, biochemistry, and materials science, etc.},

abstract = {vestigationg on dilute solutions of GR-S fractions indicates an increase in 4 with increasing concen-tration. It may be significant that the 4 values for the GR-S solutions were two to three times higher than those for the present polyisobutylene solutions. I t is important to note that the ratio of qss/c a t zero rate of shear to its value as ordinarily measured in a viscometer operating a t a standard shearing stress increases as the concentration is de-creased. This circumstance arises because y decreases with increasing concentration owing to the increase in viscosity. Ordinary extrapolation to infinite dilution applied to measurements made with a single viscometer fails, therefore, to reduce the magnitude of the error arising from non-New-tonian flow. This is especially important for high iiiolecular weight polymers in good solvents. Failure to correct for this non-Newtqnian effect will, for example, distort the observed viscosity-temperature and viscosity-concentration relation-ships. In order to obtain an accurate value of the intrinsic viscosity, it is necessary to carry out a suitable extrapolation to zero rate of shear.

In the better solvent, the volume of the domain of a single polymer molecule is larger. The number of intrachain entanglements is thus diminished and hence the polymer is more deformable. Since the forces acting on the coiled polymer molecule increase as the volume of the domain increases, and since these forces presum-ably become more effective in distorting and orient-ing the polymer molecule in the flow field as the deformability increases, both of these factors may contribute toward the observed increase in 4.

abstract = {Dry reverse micelles of the anionic twin-tailed surfactant bis(2-ethylhexyl) sulfosuccinate (AOT) dissolved in nonpolar solvents spontaneously form an organogel when p-chlorophenol is added in a 1:1 AOT:phenol molar ratio. The solvents used were benzene, toluene, m-xylene, 2,2,4-trimethylpentane (isooctane), decane, dodecane, tetradecane, hexadecane, and 2,6,10,14-tetramethylpentadecane (TMPD). The proposed microstructure of the gel is based on strands of stacked phenols linked to AOT through hydrogen bonding. Small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) spectra of the organogels suggest a characteristic length scale for these phenol-AOT strands that is independent of concentration but dependent on the chemical nature of the nonpolar solvent used. Correlation lengths determined from the SAXS spectra indicate that the strands self-assemble into fibers. Direct visualization of the gel in its native state is accomplished by using tapping mode atomic force microscopy (AFM). It is shown that these organogels consist of fiber bundle assemblies. The SAXS and AFM data reinforce the theory of a molecular architecture consisting of three length scales-AOT/phenolic strands (ca. 2 nm in diameter) that self-assemble into fibers (ca. 10 nm in diameter), which then aggregate into fiber bundles (ca. 20-100 nm in diameter) and form the organogel.},

To first order, the interaction can be considered an electrostatic attraction between a positive charge and the quadrupole moment of the aromatic. A great deal of direct and circumstantial evidence indicates that cation-pi interactions are important in a variety of proteins that bind cationic ligands or substrates. In this context, the amino acids phenylalanine (Phe), tyrosine (Tyr), and tryptophan (Trp) can be viewed as polar, yet hydrophobic, residues.},

The systematic use of contrast-matching, by alternately highlighting or hiding one of the surfactants, confirms that mixed micelles are formed. In salt-free solutions, mixed spherical micelles are formed and a core-shell model combined with a Hayter-Penfold potential was used to describe the data. The core radius is dominated by the EHAC tails and the outer radius determined by the ethoxylate headgroups of the nonionic surfactant. Addition of KCl promotes micellar growth; however, results of varying the solvent contrast revealed that when the nonionic surfactant is incorporated into the wormlike structure micellar breaking is promoted. Thus, mixed wormlike micelles with shorter contour lengths compared to the pure EHAC worms are formed.},

All three solutes stabilize the lamellar liquid-crystalline phase at the expense of lamellar-gel phase and inverted hexagonal phase of the phospholipid when present in concentrations up to 3 M. X-ray diffraction data demonstrated that the repeat spacing of DOPE increased with increasing urea concentration, but decreased as the DMU and TMU concentrations increased. The repeat spacing of DOPE in the liquid-crystal phase dispersed in the three solutes is d(urea) {\textgreater} d(DMU) {\textgreater} d(TMU). The molecular mechanisms underlying these observations are discussed in terms of either membrane Hofmeister effect, where urea acts as a water structure breaker, or a direct insertion effect of the amphiphilic DMU and TMU molecules into the lipid head groups in the interfacial region of the phospholipid bilayer. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

abstract = {The three-dimensional structure determination of RNAs by NMR spectroscopy relies on chemical shift assignment, which still constitutes a bottleneck. In order to develop more efficient assignment strategies, we analysed relationships between sequence and 1H and 13C chemical shifts. Statistics of resonances from regularly Watson–Crick base-paired RNA revealed highly characteristic chemical shift clusters. We developed two approaches using these statistics for chemical shift assignment of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA): a manual approach that yields starting points for resonance assignment and simplifies decision trees and an automated approach based on the recently introduced automated resonance assignment algorithm FLYA. Both strategies require only unlabeled RNAs and three 2D spectra for assigning the H2/C2, H5/C5, H6/C6, H8/C8 and H1′/C1′ chemical shifts. The manual approach proved to be efficient and robust when applied to the experimental data of RNAs with a size between 20 nt and 42 nt. The more advanced automated assignment approach was successfully applied to four stem-loop RNAs and a 42 nt siRNA, assigning 92–100{\%} of the resonances from dsRNA regions correctly. This is the first automated approach for chemical shift assignment of non-exchangeable protons of RNA and their corresponding 13C resonances, which provides an important step toward automated structure determination of RNAs.},

abstract = {Many proteins are surface active molecules and form stable emulsions. In these emulsions, the protein covered oil droplets behave as sticky droplets even when they are ionically charged. As a result of the stickiness of the droplets the emulsions have gel-like properties. The stickiness is due to the multipolar nature of the proteins in contrast to the bipolar nature of surfactants or other amphiphilic compounds that form emulsions with repulsive droplets. Stable emulsions are also formed from particles like clays to which proteins are adsorbed. These hybrid compounds form even more stable emulsions with stronger elastic properties than clays and proteins on their own. These so called pickering emulsions have paste-like properties and do not flow. The scaffolding network of the crosslinked protein bilayers on the droplets is so strong that both the water and the oil can be removed from the emulsions by freeze drying without collapse of the scaffold. The resulting sponge can be used again for the uptake of both water and oil. Emulsions which are prepared from different proteins differ mainly in their elastic properties. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

The existence and strength of the intramolecular hydrogen bond in diols are gauged in terms of the electron density at the bond saddle points.

Further, the nature of water...water as well as diol...water interactions is appraised employing many-body energy decomposition analysis. It is seen that water...water interactions are more favorable in vicinal diol...6H(2)O than those in 1,n-diol...6H(2)O (n=3, 4, 5,...) complexes. Exactly opposite trends are shown by diol...water interaction energies. Thus vicinal diols, being more effective at strengthening water...water network, are expected to act as water structuring agents, whereas the non-vicinal diols are expected to be water destructuring agents.},

Details of the method and results obtained will be presented in this paper. In comparison with the tracer electrophoresis method used in determining the zeta potential of a surfactant micelle, this method is much time saving and less laborious. The zeta potential values of one anionic and three cationic surfactant micelles have been determined by using this method. From the zeta potential versus concentration curve. one can determine the micellar dissociation concentration and the critical micellar concentration of a surfactant. The values obtained agree quite well with the surface tension measurement. The surfanant systems were studied in the presence and absence of NaCI. The zeta potential appears to decrease with the increase of NaCl concentration. Zeta potential is a very imponant factor which determines the electrokinetic},

abstract = {Cylindrical micelles are known to exhibit two types of morphologies: branched networks and linear, worm-like (or thread-like) micelles. These structures correspond to two types of topological defects: end-caps and junction points. Although either type of defect increases the micelle energy (when compared to the cylindrical sections), they are stabilized by an increase in the translational (end-caps) or configurational (junctions) entropy. End-caps reduce the length of the cylindrical micelles, resulting in a suspension of linear, worm-like micelles. Y-junction branch points cause the formation of a network structure that may percolate and coexist thermodynamically with a "sol" of finite cylinders with end-caps. In this paper, we review current experimental and theoretical studies of non-ionic cylindrical micelles in aqueous solutions. We focus on single and multicomponent amphiphiles, and consider both small molecules and macromolecules (polymers), in order to identify the driving forces that determine the type of topological 'defect' and the resulting system morphology. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Mixed micelles assoc. with polyelectrolytes of opposite charge to form sol. or insol. complexes. The interaction takes place abruptly (signaled by a sudden enhancement in scattering) upon an increase of micelle surface charge d., an increase in polymer linear charge d., or a decrease in ionic strength (I) and involves a microscopic or macroscopic phase change. Because the surface charge state and the dimensions of the mixed micelles may be varied over a wide range, the polyion-micelle system provides a useful model for polyelectrolyte-colloid interactions. Turbidimetric titrns. were carried out over a range of ionic strengths for two systems. One is composed of cationic/nonionic micelles of dimethyldodecylamine oxide (DMDAO) in the presence of the strong polyanion poly(2-acrylamido-2-methylpropanesulfonic acid, sodium salt) (PAMPS) or its lower charge d. copolymer with N-vinylpyrrolidone (P(AMPS-NVP)). The other consists of mixed anionic/nonionic micelles of SDS and dodecylhexa(oxyethylene) glycol (C12E6) in the presence of the polycation poly(dimethyldiallylammonium chloride) (PDMDAAC). The results provide the ionic strength dependence of the crit. micelle compn. for polyion-micelle assocn. From these exptl. phase boundaries, along with appropriate potentiometric or fluorescence probe measurements, one obtains the crit. micelle surface potential. For both systems, the crit. surface charge d. (sc) depends on the square root of the ionic strength (I). This result is particularly meaningful in the DMDAO systems, in which the absence of bulky surfactant headgroups means that sc can be defined clearly. The focus exclusively is on the pH and I regions in which the micelle maintains const. spherical shape. The observations for the DMDAO system may then be compared to relevant theories for the interaction of polyelectrolytes with oppositely charged surfaces. In addn., a simplified treatment is suggested for a spherical charged surface which yields the obsd. sc .apprx. I1/2 relation. Analyses of the electrostatic potential decay curves for the systems DMDAO-PAMPS and DMDAO-P(AMPS-NVP) under crit. conditions suggest that the mean position of polyion segments binding to the micelle is .apprx.6 .ANG. from the micelle surface and that a potential of +5 mV at this location is required for binding to take place. For mixed micelles of SDS/C12E6 with PDMDAAC, it appears that the oxyethylene head groups obstruct the approach of the polycation, so that the distance between polyion segments and the sulfonate head groups is more difficult to define.

The surfactants do not aggregate in hmimBF4, whereas they are essentially immiscible with emimBF4. That is, the surfactants are highly solvophilic to hmimBF4, while are highly solvophobic to emimBF4. In mixtures of emimBF4and hmimBF4micellization was observed. The critical micelle concentration (cmc) decreased and the mean hydrodynamic diameter of micelles, and hence, the micellar aggregation number, increased with increase in mole fraction of emimBF4in the ionic liquid mixture.1H NMR chemical shift analysis revealed that hmimBF4interacts with surfactant molecules preferentially in the ionic liquid mixture through interaction of hexyl groups with the surfactant hydrocarbon chains.

Highlighting the structural similarities of amphiphilic block copolymers to surfactants, this volume elucidates the dynamics of more complex self-assemblies that surfactants and amphiphilic block copolymers form in solutions.  The book first discusses self-assembling processes taking place in aqueous surfactant solutions and the dynamic character of surfactant self-assemblies. The next chapter reviews methods that permit the study of the dynamics of self-assemblies. The dynamics of micelles of surfactants and block copolymers, solubilized systems, microemulsions, vesicles, and lyotropic liquid crystals/mesophases are reviewed successively. The authors point out the similarities and differences in the behavior of these different self-assemblies. Much emphasis is put on the processes of surfactant exchange and of micelle formation/breakdown that determine the surfactant residence time in micelles, and the micelle lifetime. The last three chapters cover topics for which the dynamics of surfactant self-assemblies can be important for a better understanding of observed behaviors: dynamics of surfactant adsorption on surfaces, rheology of viscoelastic surfactant solutions, and kinetics of chemical reactions performed in surfactant self-assemblies used as microreactors.  Dynamics of Surfactant Self-Assemblies offers a unique and comprehensive review of the literature that exists on the dynamics of the various surfactant self-assemblies and a unified perspective on this topic. It provides researchers with a useful guide for the dynamics of the surfactant systems that they wish to investigate.},

The diversity of lpvalues in amphiphilic systems is demonstrated as well as the relation between L and lp.

Many aspects of viscoelasticity - such as non-linearity, shear banding, flow-induced phase transition, rheochaos - are only shortly described. The prevailing application of worm micelles, namely as fracture fluids and drag reducing agents are discussed in detail, stressing the effect of variations in the surfactant molecular structure on the efficacy of worm micelles.

abstract = {Major biological processes occur at the biological membrane. One of the great challenges is to understand the function of chemical or biological molecules inside the membrane; as well of those involved in membrane trafficking. This requires obtaining a complete picture of the in situ structure and dynamics as well as the topology and orientation of these molecules in the membrane lipid bilayer. These led to the creation of several innovative models of biological membranes in order to investigate the structure and dynamics of amphiphilic molecules, as well as integral membrane proteins having single or multiple transmembrane segments. Because the determination of the structure, dynamics and topology of molecules in membranes requires a macroscopic alignment of the system, a new membrane model called 'bicelles' that represents a crossover between lipid vesicles and classical micelles has become very popular due to its property of spontaneous self-orientation in magnetic fields. In addition, crucial factors involved in mimicking natural membranes, such as sample hydration, pH and salinity limits, are easy to control in bicelle systems. Bicelles are composed of mixtures of long chain (14-18 carbons) and short chain phospholipids (6-8 carbons) hydrated up to 98{\%} with buffers and may adopt various morphologies depending on lipid composition, temperature and hydration. We have been developing bicelle systems under the form of nano-discs made of lipids with saturated or biphenyl-containing fatty acyl chains. Depending on the lipid nature, these membranous nano-discs may be macroscopically oriented with their normal perpendicular or parallel to the magnetic field, providing a natural 'molecular goniometer' for structural and topological studies, especially in the field of NMR. Bicelles can also be spun at the magic angle and lead to the 3D structural determination of molecules in membranes. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.},

The detergent concentration, C-d, of each solution is fixed at 0.025 M, the electrolyte concentration is 0.1 M KCl, but the concentration of the additive, C-s, is varied to induce the structural transition. The self-diffusion coefficient, D-m, of ferrocene solubilized within the micelles indicates a rapid growth of micelles above a threshold concentration C-s* of the additive. This behavior is an indication of the formation of long threadlike micelles and subsequent entanglement of these micelles for additive concentration exceeding C-s*. Our observations suggest that the micellar growth is governed by the electrostatic interaction of the surfactant headgroups in combination with the hydrophobicity of the additive. Screening of the electrostatic interaction decreases the surface area of the headgroup leading to an increase of the packing parameter, p, which in turn promotes the growth of the micelles. The process of growth of micelles as a function of the concentration of the additive was also monitored by probing the diffusion coefficient, D-p, of polystyrene (PS) probe particles incorporated in these micellar solutions. The D-p value decreases rapidly above a threshold concentration of the additive due to the confinement of particles in the network of polymer like micelles. The observed variation in D-p correlates with the self-diffusion coefficient, D-m, of the micelles as obtained from cyclic voltammetric measurements.},

abstract = {Fluids whose flow properties can be altered by light are an emerging class of functional materials, with potential applications in microscale actuators and valves. While many such photorheological (PR) fluids have been developed over the years, most are based on specialized organized molecules that require synthesis. We have instead sought to develop PR fluids using inexpensive chemical components that are commercially available, and this approach has been successfully applied to aqueous systems. Here, we demonstrate a simple class of nonaqueous PR fluids based on the phospholipid, lecithin, and the organic derivative, para-coumaric acid (PCA). The combination of lecithin with the trans form of PCA results in reverse wormlike micelles, which are long, flexible chains that undergo entanglement, thereby giving rise to viscoelastic fluids. Upon UV irradiation, trans-PCA is photoisomerized to its cis form, which has a lower polarity and hydrogen-bonding tendency. This causes a significant reduction in the length of the micellar chains, and in turn, the fluid viscosity drops more than 1000-fold. We show that photoresponsive reverse micelles can be formed in a range of organic solvents including cyclohexane, n-alkanes, alkenes, and fatty acid esters. {\textcopyright} 2009 American Chemical Society.},

abstract = {Specific ion effects in surfactant solutions affect the properties of micelles. Dodecyltrimethylammonium chloride (DTAC), bromide (DTAB), and methanesulfonate (DTAMs) micelles are typically spherical, but some organic anions can induce shape or phase transitions in DTA(+) micelles. Above a defined concentration, sodium triflate (NaTf) induces a phase separation in dodecyltrimethylammonium triflate (DTATf) micelles, a phenomenon rarely observed in cationic micelles. This unexpected behavior of the DTATf/NaTf system suggests that DTATf aggregates have unusual properties. The structural properties of DTATf micelles were analyzed by time-resolved fluorescence quenching, small-angle X-ray scattering, nuclear magnetic resonance, and electron paramagnetic resonance and compared with those of DTAC, DTAB, and DTAMs micelles. Compared to the other micelle types, the DTATf micelles had a higher average number of monomers per aggregate, an uncommon disk-like shape, smaller interfacial hydration, and restricted monomer chain mobility. Molecular dynamic simulations supported these observations. Even small water-soluble salts can profoundly affect micellar properties; our data demonstrate that the -CF3 group in Tf(-) was directly responsible for the observed shape changes by decreasing interfacial hydration and increasing the degree of order of the surfactant chains in the DTATf micelles.},

abstract = {We present a detailed description of a molecular‐thermodynamic approach which consists of blending a molecular model of micellization with a thermodynamic theory of phase behavior and phase separation of isotropic (surfactant–water) micellar solutions. The molecular model incorporates the effects of solventproperties and surfactant molecular architecture on physical factors which control micelle formation and growth. These factors include (i) hydrophobic interactions between surfactant hydrocarbon chains and water, (ii) conformational effects associated with hydrocarbon‐chain packing in the micellar core, (iii) curvature‐dependent interfacial effects at the micellar core–water interface, and (iv) steric and electrostatic interactions between surfactanthydrophilic moieties. The free energy of micellization g mic is computed for various micellar shapes S h and micellar‐core minor radii l c . The ‘‘optimum'' equilibrium values, l * c , S h*, and g * mic, are obtained by minimizing g mic with respect to l c and S h. The deduced ‘‘optimum'' micellar shape S h* determines whether the micelles exhibit two‐dimensional, one‐dimensional, or no growth. These results are then utilized in the thermodynamic theory to predict a broad spectrum of micellar solution equilibrium properties as a function of surfactant concentration and temperature. These properties include (1) the critical micellar concentration, (2) the micellar size distribution, (3) the critical surfactant concentration for the onset of phase separation, and (4) other thermodynamic properties such as the osmotic compressibility. The proposed molecular‐thermodynamic approach provides an excellent description of a wide range of experimental findings in aqueous solutions of nonionic surfactants belonging to the polyoxyethylene glycol monoether and glucoside families.},

Mixtures of ChEO10/MCL in water form highly viscoelastic wormlike micelle solutions (WLM) over a range of concentrations; herein, the composition was fixed at 10 wt {\%} ChEO10/3 wt {\%} MCL. The addition of methylated $\beta$-CDs (MBCD, DIMEB, TRIMEB) induced a substantial disruption of the solid-like viscoelastic behavior, as shown from a loss of the Maxwell behavior, a large reduction in G' and G″ in oscillatory frequency-sweep measurements, and a drop of the viscosity. The disruption increased with the degree of substitution, following: MBCD {\textless} DIMEB {\textless} TRIMEB. Cryo-TEM images confirmed a loss of the WLM networks, revealing short rods and disc-like aggregates, which were corroborated by small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) measurements. Critical aggregation concentrations (CAC), measured by fluorescence spectroscopy, increased in the presence of DIMEB for both ChEO10 and MCL, suggesting the existence of interactions between methylated $\beta$-CDs and both surfactants involved in WLM formation. Instead, hydroxyl-$\beta$-CDs had a very different effect on the WLM. HPBCD only slightly reduced the solid-like behavior, without suppressing it. Quite remarkably, the addition of HEBCD reinforced the solid-like characteristics and increased the viscosity 10-fold. Cryo-TEM images confirmed the subsistence of WLM in ChEO10/MCL/HEBCD solutions, while SANS data revealed a slight elongation and thickening of the worms, and an increase of associated water molecules. CAC data showed that HPBCD had little effect on either surfactant, while HEBCD strongly affected the CAC of MCL and only slightly affected the ChEO10. For both DIMEB and HEBCD, time-resolved SANS measurements showed that morphology changes underlying these macroscopic changes occur in less than 100 ms.},

From rheological and X-ray scattering studies as well as from freeze fracture imaging, some general patterns of the phase behavior were observed which are remarkably different from those observed for monomeric surfactants. The sequence of phases observed with increasing surfactant concentration was an isotropic wormlike micellar phase, multilayered structures which are first isotropic and then organized with orientational ordering, and an inverted hexagonal phase. The multilayered phase showed a scattering peak corresponding to a periodicity of 40 Angstrom indicating the presence of stacks of bilayers without a water layer in between. For some of the samples, cryo-TEM showed that wormlike micelles (WLM) evolve into a ribbonlike structure (elongated bilayer). Upon further increase in concentration, the ribbons transform into multilayered structures with a well-defined width.},

Reversible switching between liquid-like and gel-like states was exhibited by the system on adjusting the solution p H. Self-assembled structures, responsible for the changes in flow properties were identified using rheology, light scattering techniques and cryogenic Transmission Electron Microscopy (cryo-TEM). High-viscosity, shear-thinning behavior and Maxwell-type dynamic rheology shown by the system at certain p H values suggested the growth of spheroidal/short cylindrical micelles into long and entangled structures. Light scattering profiles also supported the notion of p H-induced microstructural transitions in the solution. Cryo-TEM images confirmed the presence of spheroidal/short cylindrical micelles in the low-viscosity sample whereas very long and entangled thread-like micelles in the peak viscosity sample. p H-dependent changes in the micellar binding ability of phthalic acid is proposed as the key factor regulating the morphological transformations and related flow properties of the system.Graphical abstract: [Figure not available: see fulltext.].},

abstract = {The viscoelasticity of a fluid was tuned with the Faradaic reaction of (11-ferrocenylundecyl)trimethylammonium bromide (FTMA), a "redox-switchable" surfactant. An aqueous solution of the reduced form of FTMA exhibited a remarkable viscoelasticity in the presence of sodium salicylate (NaSal) because of the formation of three-dimensional entanglement of wormlike micelles. Electrolytic oxidation of FTMA caused the viscosity of the system to dramatically decrease and the elasticity to disappear. This drastic decrease in viscoelasticity arose from the disruption of wormlike micelles. This novel electrorheological phenomenon is expected to be applicable to ink for inkjet printers, the electrochemically controlled release of substances entrapped in wormlike micelles of FTMA, and fluid flow rate control using electric signals.},

abstract = {A microscopic theory is developed which can describe many of the structural and thermodynamic properties of infinitely dilute solutions of apolar solutes in liquid water. The theory is based on an integral equation for the pair correlation functions associated with spherical apolar species dissolved in water. It requires as input the experimentally determined oxygen--{\{})xygen correlation function for pure liquid water. The theory is tested by computing thermodynamic properties for aqueous solutions of apolar solute species. The predictions of both the Henry's Law constant and the entropy of solution are in good agreement with experiment. The calculation of the latter quantity is essentially independent of any adjustable parameters. It is shown how the correlation functions we have calculated can be used to predict the solubility of more complicated, aspherical, and nonrigid solutes in liquid water. For the more complex molecules it is convenient to study the difference between the excess chemical potential of the molecule and the chemical potentials of its separated components (Ben-Naim's measure of the hydrophobic interaction strength oA {\~{}}I). A generalized formula for oA Z/I) is presented which reduces to Ben-Nairn's result in the special case of a rigid solute. The calculations of oA Z/I) for normal alkanes through n-decane are independent of unknown and adjustable mean field parameters. For ethane. the theoretical results for oA Z/I) are in good agreement with experimental data. To treat longer alkanes multipoint correlation functions are required. It is shown that the standard superposition approximation for the multipoint correlation functions predicts qualitatively incorrect results. A correction to the superposition approximation is developed. Its use yields theoretical values for oA Z/I) which agree well with experiment. We also calculate free energies of transfer of n -alkane solutes from a hydrocarbon solvent to liquid water. Here, too, our results are in good agreement with experiment. After testing the theory against experiment, several experimentally inaccessible aspects of the hydrophobic effect are discussed. Analysis of pair correlation functions between spherical apolar species indicates that the hydrophobic interaction becomes more attractive as the solute size is increased at constant temperature, or as the temperature is decreased. The solute-solute correlations in liquid water are compared with those in a nonassociated (hard-spherelike) solvent. Plots are presented which indicate that the insertion of an apolar species increases the intermolecular structure of water in the vicinity of the apolar solute. The effects of solvent environments on the conformations of small chain molecules are discussed. It is shown that hydrocarbon solvents as well as water tend to reduce the spatial extension of the chain molecules from what is found in the gas phase. However, calculations which take cognizance of the detailed structure of the solvent liquids reveal that the average conformational structure of some n -alkanes may be more compact in some non associated solvents than in water.}},

abstract = {Polymers with high molecular weight and worm-like micelles are drag-reducing agents under turbulent flow. However, in contrast to the polymeric systems, the worm-like micelles do not undergo mechanical degradation due to the turbulence, because their macromolecular structure can be spontaneously restored. This very favorable property, together with their drag-reduction capability, offer the possibility to use such worm-like micelles in heating and cooling systems to recirculate water while expending less energy. The formation, growth, and stability of worm-like micelles formed by cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) and sodium salicylate (NaSal) were investigated using the self-fluorescence of salicylate ions and the ability of the giant micelles to promote hydrodynamic drag reduction under turbulent flow. The turbulence in solutions of CTAB-Sal was produced within the double-gap cell of a rotational rheometer. Detailed diagrams were obtained for different ratios of Sal and CTAB, which revealed transitions associated with the thermal stability of giant micelles under turbulent flow.},

The source pressure was measured by using an ion gauge which was calibrated by a Hasting gauge mounted on a regular probe. When CS2 was used as a charge-exchange gas, its pressure was varied in the range 0.05-0.4 torr. The apparatus used for low-pressure ion-molecule reaction studies was a home-built FTMSN controlled by a Nicolet FTMS-1000 data system. The cell was located in a magnetic field of 1.2 T. The trapping voltage was to 1 V. The ions were formed by an electron beam biased at 9-15 eV and pulsed for 5 ms. The ions were excited by a 800-kHz excitation bandwidth "chirp" and measured by acquiring the mass spectrum over the mass range 20-150 amu at variable time delays ranging from 1 to 700 ms.

Abstract: In order to study the effect of urea on water structure, a molecular dynamics simulation of a dilute aqueous urea solution has been carried out. A rigid body model is used to represent urea, and the intermolecular potentials are given by Lennard-Jones and electrostatic terms. Only very small differences are observed between the properties of water molecules in the solvation region of urea and the bulk, and these differences can be assigned to direct urea-water interactions, with no substantial perturbation of water-water interactions. Implications for the mechanism of solubilization of hydrocarbons by urea are discussed.},

abstract = {The ideas of the first and second papers in this series, which make it possible to interpret entropy data in terms of a physical picture, are applied to binary solutions, and equations are derived relating energy and volume changes when a solution is formed to the entropy change for the process. These equations are tested against data obtained by various authors on mixtures of normal liquids, and on solutions of non-polar gases in normal solvents. Good general agreement is found, and it is concluded that in such solutions the physical picture of molecules moving in a "normal'' manner in each others' force fields is adequate. As would be expected, permanent gases, when dissolved in normal liquids, loosen the forces on neighboring solvent molecules producing a solvent reaction which increases the partial molal entropy of the solute. Entropies of vaporization from aqueous solutions diverge strikingly from the normal behavior established for non-aqueous solutions. The nature of the deviations found for non-polar solutes in water, together with the large effect of temperature upon them, leads to the idea that the water forms frozen patches or microscopic icebergs around such solute molecules, the extent of the iceberg increasing with the size of the solute molecule. Such icebergs are apparently formed also about the non-polar parts of the molecules of polar substances such as alcohols and amines dissolved in water, in agreement with Butler's observation that the increasing insolubility of large non-polar molecules is an entropy effect. The entropies of hydration of ions are discussed from the same point of view, and the conclusion is reached that ions, to an extent which depends on their sizes and charges, may cause a breaking down of water structure as well as a freezing or saturation of the water nearest them. Various phenomena recorded in the literature are interpreted in these terms. The influence of temperature on certain salting out coefficients is interpreted in terms of entropy changes. It appears that the salting out phenomenon is at least partly a structural effect. It is suggested that structural influences modify the distribution of ions in an electrolyte solution, and reasons are given for postulating the existence of a super lattice structure in solutions of LaCl3 and of EuCl3. An example is given of a possible additional influence of structural factors upon reacting tendencies in aqueous solutions.},

The total surfactant concn. is fixed at 100 mM, and the ratio of the two counterions HNC- to tosylate- (.chi.2) is varied from 0 to 0.7.  The zero shear viscosity (.eta.) and the terminal time of stress relaxation (.tau.R) initially increases slowly with .chi.2 and then decreases drastically for .chi.2 {\textgreater} 0.5.  The initial increase of both .eta. and .tau.R can be explained by an increase of the micellar length owing to the more hydrophobicity of HNC-, which reduces the scission energy of the micelles due to the decrease of the electrostatic contribution.  A decrease of the .eta. and .tau.R above .chi.2 = 0.5 is attributed to the formation of intermicellar connections, which is favored at very high salt content.  The presence of intermicellar branching speeds up the reptation process and decreases the av. micellar lengths thereby reducing .eta. and .tau.R.  Anal. of the data by the theory of Cates suggests that increasing the fraction of HNC- increases the ratio of entanglement length to the contour length of the micelles.  This is consistent with the temp. dependence of the rheol. data.

Understandably, there is a widespread belief that natural languages are unsuitable for the transmission of many ideas that artificial languages can render with great precision and mathematical rigor. But this dichotomy, which has served as a premise underlying much work in the areas of linguistics and artificial intelligence, is a false one. There is at least one language, Sanskrit, which for the duration of almost 1000 years was a living spoken language with a considerable literature of its own. Besides works of literary value, there was a long philosophical and grammatical tradition that has continued to exist with undiminished vigor until the present century. Among the accomplishments of the grammarians can be reckoned a method for paraphrasing Sanskrit in a manner that is identical not only in essence but in form with current work in Artificial Intelligence. This article demonstrates that a natural language can serve as an artificial language also, and that much work in AI has been reinventing a wheel millenia old. First, a typical Knowledge Representation Scheme (using Semantic Nets) will be laid out, followed by an outline of the method used by the ancient Indian grammarians to analyze sentences unambiguously. Finally, the clear parallelism between the two will be demonstrated, and the theoretical implications of this equivalence will be given.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: HIV infection persists despite antiretroviral treatment (ART) and is reignited as soon as therapies are suspended. This vicious cycle is fueled by the persistence of viral reservoirs that are invulnerable to standard ART protocols, and thus therapeutic agents able to target these reservoirs are needed. One such agent, auranofin, has recently been shown to decrease the memory T-cell reservoir in chronically SIVmac251-infected macaques. Moreover, auranofin could synergize with a fully suppressive ART protocol and induce a drug-free post-therapy containment of viremia.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: We administered buthionine sulfoximine (BSO), an inhibitor of glutathione synthesis currently in clinical trials for cancer, in combination with auranofin to chronically SIVmac251-infected macaques under highly-intensified ART (H-iART). The ART/auranofin/BSO therapeutic protocol was followed, after therapy suspension, by a significant decrease of viral RNA and DNA in peripheral blood as compared to pre-therapy levels. Drug-free post-therapy control of the infection was achieved in animals with pre-therapy viral loads ranging from values comparable to average human set points to levels largely higher. This control was dependent on the presence CD8+ cells and associated with enhanced levels of cell-mediated immune responses.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: The level of post-therapy viral set point reduction achieved in this study is the largest reported so far in chronically SIVmac251-infected macaques and may represent a promising strategy to improve over the current "ART for life" plight.},

abstract = {The hexagonal (H) and the cubic (Q223) phases of the systems dodecyltrimethylammonium chloride-water and palmitoyllysophosphatidy choline-water have been studied by X-ray scattering techniques. The signs of the reflections of phase H were determined by a systematic study as a function of the water content, those of phase Q223 were assessed using a pattern recognition approach based upon the axiom that the histograms of the electron density maps of phases Q223 and H, extrapolated to the same concentration and properly normalized in scale and shape, are very similar to each other. In the case of phase Q223, all the sign combinations (the $\theta${\{}symbol{\}}-sets) compatible with the observed reflections were generated, and each of the corresponding histograms was compared with the histogram of the map of phase H. One novelty of this work is the use of a highly sensitive criterion to estimate the similarity of the histograms, namely the distance in the six-dimensional space of the moments [〈($\Delta$$\rho${\{}variant{\}})n〉] 1 n, for 3 ≥ n ≥ 8. In the two systems, the use of this criterion has led to the unambiguous choice of one electron density map. The maps show that the structure of phase Q223 consists of disjointed micelles (of type I), belonging to two different classes: those of one class are quasi-spherical in shape and are centred at the points a, those of the other class are disc-shaped and are centred at the points c. The results of this work rule out a structure formed by a cage-like distribution of rods enclosing a set of quasi-spherical micelles and is consistent with previous proposals. This is the second example, after that of phase Q227, of a micellar cubic phases in lipid-containing systems; all the known examples of phase Q223 are of type I, those of phase Q227 of type II. {\textcopyright} 1992.},

It is important to understand the factors underlying the hydrophobic effect because they appear to play key roles in membrane and micelle formation, protein folding, ligand-protein and protein- protein binding, chromatographic retention, possibly nucleic acid interactions, and the partitioning of drugs, metabolites, and toxins throughout the environment and living systems. Here, we survey experimental and theoretical studies of nonpolar solute partitioning into water. We note that the hydrophobic effect is not just due to “water ordering” and not merely due to small size effects of water. The properties vary substantially with temperature and solute shape. Also, we discuss the limitations of using oil/water partitioning as the basis for some thermodynamic models in chemistry and biology.},

Experimental data were analyzed by help of an improved model treating the micellization process as a two-step process. Furthermore, consideration of the state of the stock and titrated solutions during the experiment allowed for the elimination of all usually used empirical parameters. The proposed approach represents thus an essential improvement of the thermodynamic analysis of the micellization process and turned out to be (only) effective for the description of the micellization at carboxylates with moderate alkyl chain length (C8 and C10). By fitting the model equation to the experimental data, all the thermodynamic parameters of micellization for both steps were estimated. It was found that the first step is endothermic and thus a solely entropy driven processes in the studied temperature range for all investigated systems. The same goes also for the second step, except for KC10, Cs10, and NaC12 where at temperatures above ∼320 K the micellization was detected as an exothermic process. The delicate balance between entropy and enthalpy results in weak temperature dependence of (negative) Gibbs free energy which turned out as almost counterion independent quantity. The carboxylic groups are namely able to form H-bonds with water molecules, and it is quite likely that they remain strongly hydrated even upon micellization. Thus, the interactions with counterions are less expressed in comparison to those observed by other ionic surfactants (alkyl sulfates and cationic surfactants), where the micellization process was found to be an exothermic process even below ∼300 K.},

The literature presents a wealth of information on the electronic contributions to friction in metals and semiconductors but the effect of triboelectricity on friction coefficients of dielectrics is as yet poorly defined and understood. In this work, friction coefficients were measured on tribocharged polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), using three different techniques. As a result, friction coefficients at the macro- and nanoscales increase many-fold when PTFE surfaces are tribocharged, but this effect is eliminated by silanization of glass spheres rolling on PTFE. In conclusion, tribocharging may supersede all other contributions to macro- and nanoscale friction coefficients in PTFE and probably in other insulating polymers.},

The aggregation behavior of 1-methyl-4-n- dodecylpyridinium surfactants with aromatic counterions is shown to be markedly dependent on the substituent (hydrophobicity)andthe substitution pattern in the aromatic ring of the counterion. Depending on the molecular architecture of the aromatic counterion, extremely long wormlike micelles can be formed instead of (nearly) spherical micelles. NMRexperiments revealed that all aromatic counterions intercalate in between the pyridinium headgroups of the micelles, with more or less the same degree of penetration.

abstract = {Hydrotropes are a class of compounds that, at high concentrations, enhance the solubility of a variety of hydrophobic compounds in water. The mechanism of hydrotropy is still incompletely understood. In this paper, we have studied the solution-state properties in water of the hydrotropes sodium salicylate (NaS), sodium p-toluenesulfonate (NaPTS), sodium xylenesulfonate (NaXS), sodium cumenesulfonate (NaCS), and sodium butyl monoglycol sulfate (NaBMGS). We find that all these molecules self-aggregate in aqueous solution to form organized assemblies. It appears that a minimal hydrotropic concentration (MHC) is essential before hydrotropy can be displayed. We show that hydrotropy is different from salting-in or phase-mixing behavior. Hydrotropy is a collective molecular phenomenon, exhibited above the MHC. Hydrotropic compounds are seen to be surface active though somewhat less than classical surfactants. The microenvironmental features of hydrotrope assemblies are roughly comparable to those of surfactant micelles: low polarity and a microviscosity of the order of 60 cP. However, there are notable differences between hydrotrope assemblies and micelles. Solubilization by the former appears to be higher and somewhat more selective. The cooperativity displayed by hydrotrope molecules in the aggregation process is low. While hydrotropy appears above the MHC, it is not strictly analogous to the critical micelle concentration displayed by surfactants. Over 70 years ago, Neuberg' described the large increase in the solubility in water of a variety of hydrophobic compounds brought about by the addition of certain compounds. These solubility-enhancing molecules were termed hydrotropic agents or hydrotropes, and the phenomenon itself was named hydrotropy. Some examples of hydrotropes are sodium benzoate, salicylate, p-toluenesulfonate, and xylenesulfonate.2 A 2 M solution of the latter salt in water enhances the solubility of nitrobenzene 50-fold and that of cresol by a factor of 200 in water.3 Hydrotropy appears to operate at high concentrations of the hydrotrope in water; most hydrotropic solutions precipitate the solute (solubi-lizate) on dilution with water. This is convenient since it allows the ready recovery of the hydrotrope for reuse. Despite intermittent attempts over the years, there is no con-sensus on the mechanism behind hydrotropy. McKee2 suggested that hydrotropy may be viewed as a salting-in process; he noted that aqueous solutions of KI, KSCN, and NHISCN are exdlent solvents for many water-insoluble compounds. Winsor4 suggested at the same time that the hydrotrope acts as a common solvent for the hydrophilic and lipophilic compounds present, and thus, hydrotropy and cosolvency are quite similar. Ueda5 pointed out that the hydrotrope forms a complex with the solubilizate and also decreases the activity coefficient of the latter in water, both of which lead to an increase in solubility. Rath6 was concerned about the molecular structural features and stacking of hydrotropes while others had been investigating the possibility of association of these molecules into aggregates somewhat like what surfactants Heteroassociation of the solubilizate and the hydrotrope, with a variety of cohesive factors, has been noted between some drugs and hydroxybenzoate hydrotropes.12 Saleh's group has been pursuing the association behavior of hydrotropes and compared them with those of surfactants.I3-l6 (1) Neuberg, C.},

abstract = {In a series of experiments, we studied the dynamic properties of aqueous surfactant solutions of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) at conditions after adding different amounts of sodium salicylate (NaSal). The aggregates, present in these solutions, are elongated, wormlike micelles, which tend to form entanglement networks. The viscoelastic, gel-like samples were analyzed by means of static, dynamic, and electrophoretic light scattering techniques. We separately investigated the effects of surfactant concentration and added salt on intermicellar interactions. The electrostatic interactions between the anisometric micelles were analyzed by considering the effective dimensions of the aggregates. We calculated the Debye-Huckel lengths from experimental data of the osmotic second virial coefficient and from the diffusion second virial coefficient. It turned out that the results were in good agreement with theoretically estimated values. We also measured the zeta potential and intensity of scattered light in a large range of different salt concentrations keeping the CTAB concentration constant. We observed an isoelectric point and charge reversal of the threadlike micelles at an excess salicylate concentration of about 100 mM. The observed decrease of the zeta potential points to striking processes of counterion condensation. In these solutions, the salicylate ion acts as a cosurfactant, due to its discrepancy between polar and hydrophobic groups. We also detected a simple linear correlation between the zeta potentials and the Debye screening lengths of the surfactant solutions.},

Semi-dilute aqueous solutions of pDoAO show a sharp increase in viscosity, which exceeds 160 cST for concentrations {\textgreater}50. mM, leading to viscoelastic solutions. Viscoelasticity relates to the surfactant charge type. In fact this viscoelastic system reverses to fluid when acid is added (pH{\textless}2), which changes the system to cationic. Under acidic conditions the system resembles solutions of the similar cationic surfactant p-dodecyloxybenzyltrimethylammonium bromide, (pDoTABr) in terms of viscosity. Properties of aqueous solutions of pDoAO were investigated by dynamic light scattering (DLS), rheology and small angle neutron scattering (SANS). Data support the idea that small micelles grow in length (wormlike or threadlike micelles) as surfactant concentration increases and viscoelastic solutions form as micelles become entangled. The micellar diameter as calculated by different techniques is about 5. nm. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Alkyl polyethoxylates are surfactants widely used in vastly different fields, from oil exploitation to pharmaceutical applications. One of the most interesting characteristics of these surfactants is their ability to form micellar systems with specific geometry, the so-called wormlike micelle. In this study, dynamic light scattering (DLS), capillary viscometry, torque rheometry and surface tensiometry experiments were carried out in systems based on xylene, water, butanol (cosurfactant), and nona-ethyleneglycol-monododecyl ether (surfactant), with fixed surfactant:cosurfactant:oil composition (with and without oil phase) and varying overall concentration. The results showed that a transition from wormlike micelles to nanodrops was characterized by maximum relative viscosity (depending on how relative viscosity was defined), which was connected to maximum effective diameter, determined by DLS. Surface tension suggested that adsorption at the air-water interface had a Langmuir character and that the limiting value of the surfactant surface excess was independent of the presence of cosurfactant and xylene. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The course of the differential heats of dilution of a surfactant measured in an isothermal titration microcalorimeter is normally of sigmoidal type. The course of percolation of conductance of a water in oil microemulsion induced by either temperature or the water content of the system is also of sigmoidal nature. Derivation of the critical micellar concentration and the enthalpy of micellization (∆Hm) in the former has been demonstrated to be conveniently obtained by employing the Sigmoidal-Boltzmann equation (SBE). The SBE has been shown also to be conveniently applicable for accurate determination of the threshold temperature ($\theta$p) and volume fraction ($\phi$p) of percolation in the latter. Introduction Microcalorimetric determination of critical micellar concentration (cmc) following the differential enthalpy of dilution of a concentrated surfactant solution and evalu-ation of the threshold of percolation of conductance of water in oil (w/o) microemulsions are two important physico-chemical aspects of self-organizing systems. The plots of the enthalpy of dilution versus [surfactant] and log-(conductance) versus temperature or volume fraction of water are normally sigmoidal in nature whose differential forms yield maxima (or minima) that correspond to the cmc and the percolation threshold, respectively. 1-15 The enthalpy change for micellization and the net conductance change during percolation can be estimated from the difference between the initial and final states of the aforesaid sigmoidal plots. The illustrations in Figure 1 depict the above situations for ideal conditions. As demonstrated in the figure, the cmc and the enthalpy of micellization, ∆H m , as well as the threshold of percolation temperature, $\theta$ p , and the volume fraction of percolation, $\phi$ p , can be estimated without ambiguity. In practice, this is hardly achieved and evaluation of the parameters cmc, ∆H m , $\theta$ p , and $\phi$ p needs careful processing of the graphical presentations associated with experimental errors for which minimization can be attempted by increasing the experimental data points. The procedure for such evalu-ation has been put forward in the literature as cited above. In the evaluation of ∆H m , the final height of the enthalpy of dilution of the micellar solution and the initial height (pertaining to micellar dilution, demicellization, and counterion dissociation (for ionic surfactant)) are consid-ered whose difference becomes the estimate of ∆H m . In most situations, the judgment on the point of beginning of the micellar dilution may not be straightforward. The ionic dissociation of the micelles may also influence the differential enthalpy of dilution in the postmicellar state causing continuous change in the dilution course. Bach et al. 16 have proposed a procedure for handling such nonideal situations considering the experimental results of several cationic surfactants. In this procedure, infor-mation on the aggregation number, counterion binding, ion-ion interaction, enthalpy of micellization, and so forth of the self-organizing systems is required which is only very limitedly known in varied environmental conditions. Kresheck 17 has used an equation for sigmoidal variation in the differential enthalpy of dilution of micellar solution but without going into details of its general performance.},

Data from small angle neutron scattering (SANS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) were combined to undertake the structural characterization of micelles formed from the two separate series of surfactants C(n)E6 (n = 10, 12, 14) and C12E(m) (m = 5, 6, 8, 10, 12). The micellar core volume (V(core)) could be well determined with reasonable accuracy and linked to the hydrophilic-lipophilic balance (HLB) of the surfactant, with a sharp size and shape transition occurring around HLB = 12.5. NOESY NMR results revealed protrusions of the terminal methylene groups into the ethoxylate shell, thus providing direct experimental evidence for the phenomenon of "roughness" or intermixing of the core-shell interface. These detailed studies are compared with previous investigations on this model surfactant system.},

abstract = {A highly viscoelastic micellar solution of nonionic surfactants in a dilute region was recently reported. A transient network of wormlike micelles formed with the addition of short-EO-chain poly(oxyethylene) dodecyl ether surfactants (C12EO(j), j = 1-4) to poly(oxyethylene) cholesteryl ethers (ChEO(m), m = 10 and 15). A gradual increase in micellar length with an increasing C12EO(j) concentration was assumed from the results of model calculations and rheological measurements. We report in this study the results of structural investigations with small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) to confirm this assumption. Tuning from spherical to wormlike and to locally flat structures can be achieved by way of three methods. One can either increase the C12EO(j) concentration or decrease j (smaller headgroup size) at a fixed concentration of C12EO(j). The third possibility is to increase the temperature at a fixed composition. All three methods result in the same structural transition. The formation of a transient network of wormlike micelles analogous to polymer solutions can be observed with dynamic light scattering (DLS). A stretched exponential approach was applied to fit the correlation functions.},

abstract = {A simple yet novel method, isothermal titration microcalorimetry (ITC), was employed to determine the enthalpy change of salt-induced wormlike micelle formation. The observed changes in molar enthalpy of 1-hexadecyl-3-methylimidazolium bromide (C16mimBr), sodium tosylate (NaTos) and sodium salicylate (NaSal) in aqueous solutions have been measured. The transformation enthalpy change from spherical micelle to wormlike micelle ($\Delta$Htra) has been obtained from the simulation method based on the microcalorimetric data. Then the enthalpy change of wormlike micelle formation ($\Delta$Hw) was obtained using a suitable cycle which was closed by the enthalpy change of micelle formation ($\Delta$Hm) and the transformation enthalpy change ($\Delta$Htra). The value of $\Delta$Hwindicated that the wormlike micelle formation in C16mimBr/NaTos system was exothermic while it was endothermic in C16mimBr/NaSal system. The planar structure of the salicylate anion and the $\pi$-$\pi$ interaction between the salicylate anion and the aromatic headgroup of C16mimBr may attribute to this difference. Moreover, the technique presented here to obtain $\Delta$Hwcould be extended to other salt-induced wormlike micelle systems. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

For measurements of the dilational visco-elasticity of the micellar solutions the buoyant bubble profile tensiometry with harmonic bubble surface area oscillations is applied. The influence of dodecane solubilised in TX45 and mixed SDS/TX45 micelles, respectively, on the dynamic surface tension and dilational characteristics of these micellar solutions is determined. It is shown that the solubilisation of dodecane by micelles leads to a slowdown in the dynamic surface tension change and an increase in the visco-elasticity of the micellar solutions. Theoretical models proposed earlier are used for the description of the influence of solubilised dodecane on the dynamic surface tension and visco-elasticity of micellar TX45 solutions. It is shown that the presence of solubilised dodecane leads to a decrease of the CMC value, and to a decrease of the micelles diffusion coefficient. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

The formation of triplestimuli-responsive systems so far has been a challenging and important issue. In this work, a novel triplestimuli (photo-, pH-, and thermoresponsive) wormlike micelle is constructed with N-cetyl-N-methylmorpholinium bromide and trans-cinnamic acid (CA). The corresponding multiresponsive behaviors of wormlike micellar system were revealed using cryogenic transmission electron microscopy, a rheometer, and 1H NMR. The rheological properties of wormlike micellar system under different temperatures, pH conditions, and UV irradiation times are measured. As confirmed by 1H NMR, chemical structure of a CA molecule can be altered by the multiple stimulation from an exotic environment. We expect it to be a good model for triple-responsive wormlike micelles, which is helpful to understand the mechanism of triple-responsiveness and widen their applications.},

abstract = {Here, we present a detailed theoretical model describing the growth of disclike surfactant micelles. The model is tested against light-scattering data for micellar solutions from mixed conventional surfactants and from fluorinated surfactants. Theoretical expressions are derived for the concentration dependencies of the number and mass average aggregation numbers. Central role in the theory is played by the difference between the chemical potentials of a surfactant molecule in cylindrical and discoidal micelles. This difference, scaled with the thermal energy kT, is denoted p. For p{\textless}. 0, the formation of cylindrical (rather than disclike) micelles is energetically favored. For p{\textgreater}. 0 disclike micelles are formed, but their growth is limited due to the rise of their positive peripheral energy. Because of that, disclike micelles can be observed in a relatively narrow interval, 0. {\textless}. p{\textless}. 0.1, and in a limited concentration range. Three sets of light-scattering data for different surfactants were processed. It is remarkable that in all cases the best fit gives small positive values of p, in agreement with the theoretical predictions. The model predicts that a strong increase in the viscosity of a surfactant solution should happen upon the transformation of disclike micelles into cylindrical ones at small variations in p. The model can be used for analyzing the shape and size of micelles in various surfactant solutions. The fact that typical disclike micelles form only in the special case 0. {\textless}. p{\textless}. 0.1 shows why such micelles represent a relatively rare form of stable surfactant self-assembly. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Flow-SANS experiments were performed on viscoelastic aqueous solutions of erucyl bis(hydroxyethyl) methylammonium chloride in the presence of potassium chloride. This cationic surfactant has the ability to form very long and flexible wormlike micelles upon addition of salt. The effects of the key-parameters-shear rate, temperature, surfactant and salt concentration-on the ability of the micelles to align in the flow-field were investigated. The scattering data were analyzed in terms of an anisotropy factor (Af). It was found that the wormlike micelles aligned in the direction of the applied shear rate and that the anisotropy factor increased with shear rate. In addition, an increase in temperature caused a decrease of the anisotropy factor (Af) due to the formation of shorter worms. Furthermore, the branching of the micelles at high ionic strength caused the anisotropy factor to decrease in comparison with the values obtained from linear wormlike micelles, hence revealing that the formation of 3-way junctions restricts the alignment of the micelles in the shear-flow. Furthermore, the total surfactant concentration was found to affect the shear-induced patterns significantly, and different behaviors were observed depending on the ionic strength.},

abstract = {Despite over a century of modern surfactant science, the kinetic pathways of morphological transitions in micellar systems are still not well understood. This is mainly as a result of the lack of sufficiently fast methods that can capture the structural changes of such transitions. Herein, a simple surfactant system consisting of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) in aqueous NaCl solutions is investigated. Combining synchrotron radiation small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) with fast stopped-flow mixing schemes allows monitoring the process where polymer-like micelles are formed from globular micelles when the salt concentration is suddenly increased. The results show that "worm-like" micelles are formed by fusion of globular micelles and short cylinders in a fashion that bears similarities to a step-like polymerization process.},

The effect of the additive on the transition has been quantified as the change in the concentration of pentanol required to cause the transition divided by the concentration of additive, with a negative value indicating a cooperative effect of promoting the transition and a positive value indicating a retarding effect. Aliphatic hydrocarbon additives retarded the transformation for both surfactants, with the exception of a small cooperative effect for cyclohexane on TTMAB. Alkylbenzenes promoted the transition for TTMAB, as did benzene, toluene, and ethylbenzene for SDS, but the propyl and butyl derivatives showed the opposite effect.},

abstract = {Attempts have been made to determine H+ concentrations at the surface of micelles using indicator dyes, bromophenol blue and bromocresol green. In the presence of cationic micelles, the dyes are incorporated almost exclusively in the micelles, presumably with the hydrophilic groups exposed at the surface and the hydrophobic parts buried. The apparent indicator constants (Ka) for the surface, in terms of the average [H+] of the system, have been determined for cationic micelles of three chain lengths at several ionic strengths, two counterions (Cl- and Br-), arid two temperatures. The distribution of bromophenol blue between the anionic micelles of sodium lauryl sulfate and the bulk has also been investigated and the surface pKa estimated. The differences between the bulk and surface pK values have been interpreted in terms of the electrical potential difference and changes in the intrinsic pK (pKi) of the dye. Potential values intermediate between the Gouy-Chapman surface potentials and the electrokinetic potentials seem to be needed, as expected for the surface from recent theories. The surface pKi seems to be higher than the bulk value, the difference increasing with increasing charge density of the micelles. This effect is ascribed to the lowering of the effective dielectric constant at the surface. The change in pKa with micellar concentration can be explained satisfactorily by the negative adsorption from the surface, in fair quantitative agreement with theoretical predictions. The pKa varies linearly and substantially with the mole fraction of counterions. The effect is ascribed to different charge densities on the micelles and the larger effect of Br- on the decrease of the effective dielectric constant at the surface.},

abstract = {Protein structure determination by NMR can in principle be speeded up both by reducing the measurement time on the NMR spectrometer and by a more efficient analysis of the spectra. Here we study the reliability of protein structure determination based on a single type of spectra, namely nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy (NOESY), using a fully automated procedure for the sequence-specific resonance assignment with the recently introduced FLYA algorithm, followed by combined automated NOE distance restraint assignment and structure calculation with CYANA. This NOESY-FLYA method was applied to eight proteins with 63-160 residues for which resonance assignments and solution structures had previously been determined by the Northeast Structural Genomics Consortium (NESG), and unrefined and refined NOESY data sets have been made available for the Critical Assessment of Automated Structure Determination of Proteins by NMR project. Using only peak lists from three-dimensional (13)C- or (15)N-resolved NOESY spectra as input, the FLYA algorithm yielded for the eight proteins 91-98 {\%} correct backbone and side-chain assignments if manually refined peak lists are used, and 64-96 {\%} correct assignments based on raw peak lists. Subsequent structure calculations with CYANA then produced structures with root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) values to the manually determined reference structures of 0.8-2.0 {\AA} if refined peak lists are used. With raw peak lists, calculations for 4 proteins converged resulting in RMSDs to the reference structure of 0.8-2.8 {\AA}, whereas no convergence was obtained for the four other proteins (two of which did already not converge with the correct manual resonance assignments given as input). These results show that, given high-quality experimental NOESY peak lists, the chemical shift assignments can be uncovered, without any recourse to traditional through-bond type assignment experiments, to an extent that is sufficient for calculating accurate three-dimensional structures.},

abstract = {Rheology is, by common consent, a difficult subject and some of the theoretical components are often viewed as being of prohibitive complexity by scientists without a strong mathematical background. There are also the difficulties inherent in any multidisciplinary science like rheology for those with a specific training. Therefore, newcomers to the field are sometimes discouraged, and for them the existing texts on the subject - some of which are outstanding - are of limited assistance because of their depth of detail and highly mathematical nature. This book introduces the subject of rheology in terms understandable to non-experts and describes the application of rheological principles to many industrial products and processes. It provides a simple but authoritative guide which shows clearly how mathematics, physics and chemistry have contributed to the development of rheology. The generic features of all liquid-like materials are summarised, i.e. viscosity, linear viscoelasticity, normal stresses and extensional viscosity. Particular systems are then discussed, i.e. polymeric liquids and suspensions. The final chapter gives an outline of the theoretical advances which have been made. Consistent notation and nomenclature have been used throughout the book, and the key textbooks and publications which will enable the reader to follow up particular topics are listed.},

We use electrochemical microcalorimetry to directly determine the entropy change a dodecyl sulfate molecule experiences upon potential-induced adsorption from aqueous solution into a surface aggregate. From measurements of the heat, which is reversibly exchanged during the adsorption or desorption process, we determined a value of 37 ± 9 J/(mol K) for the aggregation entropy. This value is in accordance with entropies of micellization of dodecyl sulfate in solution. A comparison with estimates of the entropy of aggregation of dodecane in aqueous solutions reveals that the aggregation is driven by the entropic contribution of the hydrophobic hydrocarbon tail, in accordance with general models for the aggregation of amphiphilic molecules.},

This review describes the use of ionized phenyl salicylate ions, PSa − , as a new probe to determine KXBr values using a semiempirical spectrophotometric method. The value of KXBr is found to be comparable to reported values obtained using different probes by the semiempirical kinetic method as well as different physical methods.

The phase-transition process has great resemblance to crystal salt-out. The observation by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) proved that the hydrogel is a network structure with interweaving fibers and ribbons, which can trap an aqueous solution. The images of high-resolutionTEM(HR-TEM) indicated that each of the fibers and ribbons is composed of a bundle of parallel cylindrical nanofibers. Conductivity and in situ diffuse reflectance fourier- transform infrared (DR-FT-IR) spectroscopy measurements indicated that gel formation was induced due to a crystallization of rod micelles by Na+ ions bonding to the oxygen groups of salts of fatty carboxylates. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) showed that the increase of either the chain length of sodium soaps or the concentration of Na+ counter-ions promoted the growth of the nanofibers. We speculated that the phase transition from the micelle solution to the gel phase is a result of a crystallization of rod micelles induced by sodium ions.},

The Foerster radius has been determined from the spectral overlap of donor fluorescence and acceptor absorption (R 0=4.6 nm). The results of steady-state as well as of time-resolved investigations have been compared. The analysis of time-resolved fluorescence data by means of nonexponential decay functions yields an average area per lipid of 0.65 nm(2) in pure POPC bilayers. The area per surfactant in two-component C12E n /POPC-membranes (n=2, 4, 6) has been determined and compared with the results of X-ray investigations. The surfactant head group seems to adapt a predominantly disordered confirmation within the bilayer.},

abstract = {The ability to induce morphological transitions in water-in-oil (w/o) and water-in-CO2 (w/c) microemulsions stabilized by a trichain anionic surfactant 1,4-bis(neopentyloxy)-3-(neopentyloxycarbonyl)-1,4-dioxobutane-2-sulfonate (TC14) with simple hydrotrope additives has been investigated. High-pressure small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) has revealed the addition of a small mole fraction of hydrotrope can yield a significant elongation in the microemulsion water droplets. For w/o systems, the degree of droplet growth was shown to be dependent on the water content, the hydrotrope mole fraction, and chemical structure, whereas for w/c microemulsions a similar, but less significant, effect was seen. The expected CO2 viscosity increase from such systems has been calculated and compared to related literature using fluorocarbon chain surfactants. This represents the first report of hydrotrope-induced morphology changes in w/c microemulsions and is a significant step forward toward the formation of hydrocarbon worm-like micellar assemblies in this industrially relevant solvent.},

abstract = {A wealth of information dealing with the history of ce- ramics, pottery, architecture, sculpture, and metalsmithing can he found unon a visit to a local universitv lihrarv. In con- trast, very little has been written of the chemistry of ancient naintines. Few manuscrints and hooks are available that give brecise;ecipes or techniques of the ancient painting craft. There are some terms mentioned in old books and manu- scripts referring to general terms as "resins," "tempera," "nlaster." hut specific details are not outlined. 0rigi"ally the.artist, the scientist, and the technologist were one and the same. The scientist tries to understand why things are the way they are; the artist searches for new ways of using technoloev to oursne an endeavor for aesthetic pleasure; and the techhoglst produces a needed tool or object. Modern chemical analvsis has given us some new information so that we can begin to decipher the mystery of antiquity. It is not necessary to study art to view a painting. The same holds true for the enjoyment of any art form, although knowledge might increase awareness of the reasons for en- joyment. Many art history hooks deal with the aesthetic qualities of a painting and the development of representation throughout the ages, as painters were able to move from a two-dimensional to a three-dimensional realistic represen- tation. Painters in the same localities seem to paint very muchlike one another. In studying the history of art and science, there seems to he a correlation for this similarity. As the "scientist" discovers new methods and chemicals, so the "artist" can change techniques and styles. Quotes are placed around the words scientist and artist, since, in many cases, they are one and the same. The "artist" ex{\~{}}eriments with a variety of chemicals to produce a desired p(gment and permanence. Does that make himlher anv less a scientist? In a ureoccupation with the classification of knowledge into subjects, history has overlooked the interdependence of people for knowledge that is needed in each discipline. This paper does not deal with the thousands of paintings as aesthetic creatures; rather it ex- plores the intricate dependence of chemicals upon one another to produce the beauty.},

To obtain general information concerning their order of magnitude the London-v. d. Waals interaction between two spherical particles is computed as a function of the diameters and the distance separating them. A table is calculated which enables numerical application of the formulae derived. Besides approximations are added, which may be used when the distance between the particles is small. In a separate section it is investigated how the results must be modified, when both particles are immersed in a liquid. Here we are led to the important conclusion that even in that case London-v. d. Waals forces generally cause an attraction. {\textcopyright} 1937.},

abstract = {Molecular dynamics simulations of the protein chymotrypsin inhibitor 2 in 8 M urea at 60 degrees C were undertaken to investigate the molecular basis of chemical denaturation. The protein unfolded rapidly under these conditions, but it retained its native structure in a control simulation in water at the same temperature. The overall process of unfolding in urea was similar to that observed in thermal denaturation simulations above the protein's T(m) of 75 degrees C. The first step in unfolding was expansion of the hydrophobic core. Then, the core was solvated by water and later by urea. The denatured structures in both urea and at high temperature contained residual native helical structure, whereas the beta-structure was completely disrupted. The average residence time for urea around hydrophilic groups was six times greater than around hydrophobic residues and in all cases greater than the corresponding water residence times. Water self-diffusion was reduced 40{\%} in 8 M urea. Urea altered water structure and dynamics, thereby diminishing the hydrophobic effect and encouraging solvation of hydrophobic groups. In addition, through urea's weakening of water structure, water became free to compete with intraprotein interactions. Urea also interacted directly with polar residues and the peptide backbone, thereby stabilizing nonnative conformations. These simulations suggest that urea denatures proteins via both direct and indirect mechanisms.},

The most important findings in this study are the following. From a screening test of many carboxylic acids for gelation, it was found that the number and position of the carboxyl groups of the multivalent carboxylic acids are the determinants for the formation of reverse worm-like micelles, and appropriate carboxylic acids such as citric acid and 1,2,3-propanetricarboxylic acid can change the lecithin/oil solution into a gel. Furthermore, upon addition of these carboxylic acids, the zero-shear viscosity of solutions increased monotonically until phase separation or cloudiness occurred. For example, when citric acid was used, the maximum zero-shear viscosity of the solution was 70,000,000 times larger than that of n-decane. From studies on the scaling of rheological parameters, it was found that further addition of multivalent carboxylic acids not only induced the formation of linear reverse worm-like micelles but also brought about their branching. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {The number of physico-chemical investigations of surfactants in solution, whether aqueous or nonaqueous, has dramatically increased in recent years. However, literature reports on surfactants in solutions are scattered over a plethora of scientific journals and books which differ widely in scope and readership. Such data are often difficult to retrieve because there have been no systematic compilations, with the exception of those for CMCs and for micelle aggregation numbers. The present compilation meets that need by covering, as completely as possible, the physico-chemical properties of selected series of homologous surfactants. These surfactants are in most cases isomerically pure, are well-known, and have been used in numerous academic and industrial studies. The properties include aggregation number, cloud point, CMC, 13C-NMR, correlation length, counterion binding, density, enthalpy of micelle formation, entropy of micelle formation, Gibbs' free energy of micelle formation, head group area, 1H-NMR, hydration number, Krafft temperature, melting point, micelle radius, microscopic viscosity, miscibility curve, partial molar volume, phase inversion temperature, refractive index, self-diffusion coefficient, surface tension, and upper critical temperature. The book also contains two- and three-component phase diagrams of many nonionic surfactants.The solvent is water in most cases; however, some data refer to properties in D2O, electrolyte solutions, and nonaqueous solvents. The variables are temperature and concentration. Where possible, the method of measurement is given. Data on the purity of the compounds and the accuracy of the measurement methods are not included, as these can easily be found in the original sources, which mostly date from the period 1970-1991 and are given at the end of each chapter. The Index section contains a compound index, a property index, a symbol index and a cross index which facilitate easy access to the data.This valuable collection of data will be of great use to anyone involved in Colloid and Surface Science, academics as well as industrial workers, and will stimulate further work.},

The following are revealed: The cylindrical micelles are not thermodynamically stable ones but are temporally formed in the course of micelle formation. Micellization from the unimer state or micellar relaxation from one micelle state to another micelle state does not monotonically proceed to reach the destination but passes through the formation of cylindrical micelles having association numbers larger than those of both initial and equilibrium micelles. At lower temperatures and lower concentrations, the cylindrical micelles with larger size and longer time stability are easily formed. The formation of the large cylindrical micelles is the result of a rapid growth of micelles by elongating into the cylindrical shape, which may come from bilayer structure of the micelles.},

abstract = {Molecules or ions which are amphiphilic, i.e. contain at the same time a hydrophilic and a hydrophobic (normally an alkyl chain) part frequently display in aqueous solutions a characteristic strongly cooperative association into colloidal aggregates termed micelles. A general treatment of micellization and related phenomena is given in order to provide an understanding on a molecular level. Hydrophobic interactions are the driving force in micellization but the inclusion of hydrophilic group interactions is required in the thermodynamic description. Intra- and intermicellar electrostatic repulsions are discussed in connection with the changes in micelle shape occuring at higher concentrations or at addition of electrolyte etc. The kinetics of micelle formation is characterized by two greatly different time constants, the rapid one referring to the micelle-monomer exchange and the other to the dissolution and formation of micelles. A large number of physico-chemical methods applicable to the study of micelle formation are surveyed with special emphasis on recent spectroscopic approaches which give a detailed insight into structure, dynamics and interactions. For example, the hydrocarbon chains are characterized by a rapid but slightly hindered motion. The polar head-groups are hydrated while otherwise no appreciable water-amphiphile contact occurs in the micelles. The binding of small counter-ions to micelles of ionic amphiphiles is characterized by a marked specificity affecting both spectroscopic and macroscopic properties. The phenomena of solubilization, mixed micelle formation and micellar catalysis are discussion on a molecular basis as well as the formation of reversed micelles and amphiphile aggregation in non-aqueous media. The biological implications of micelle formation are briefly indicated. {\textcopyright} 1979.},

abstract = {A novel gold(I) complex with rimantadine (RTD) was obtained and structurally characterized by a set of chemical and spectroscopic analysis.1H,13C and15N nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and infrared (IR) spectroscopic measurements suggest coordination of the ligand to Au(I) through the N atom of the ethanamine group. Theoretical (DFT) calculations confirmed the IR assignments and permit proposing an optimized geometry for the complex. The gold(I)-rimantadine complex (Au-RTD) is soluble in methanol, ethanol, dimethylsulfoxide, acetone and acetonitrile. The preliminary kinetic studies based on UV-vis spectroscopic measurements indicate the stability of the compound in solution. Antibacterial activities of the complex were evaluated by an antibiogram assay. The Au-RTD complex showed an effective in vitro antibacterial activity against the Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli (Gram-negative), and Staphylococcus aureus (Gram-positive) bacterial strains. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {In this study, the solubilization of two organic dyes, Sudan I (1-phenylazo-2-naphtol) and Quinizarin (1,4-dihydroxyanthraquinone), was studied in the presence of different types of surfactants (nonionic, anionic, cationic, and nonionic block copolymers) using UV-vis spectroscopy. The effects of temperature, pH and electrolyte on dye solubilization were investigated for single surfactants and for binary surfactant mixtures. The results showed that the solubilization of both dyes in the surfactant micelles increased with the temperature and with addition of salt and that there was no synergy when a mixture of surfactants was used. A straight chain alkyl tail seemed to be better than an alkylaryl tail, as judged from the comparison of solubilization power for the pairs sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS)/sodium dodecyl benzene sulphonate (SDBS) and penta(ethylene glycol)monoundecyl ether (C11E5)/nona(ethylene glycol)monononylphenyl ether (NPE9). While the solubilization of both dyes in the presence of SDS and C11E5remained almost the same within the pH interval 3-12, the solubilization of the dyes was much higher above pH 8.2 in the presence of the cationic surfactant dodecyltrimethylammonium bromide. This was attributed to an attractive interaction between the ionized form of the dye and the positively charged head group of the micellized surfactant. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

The bleaching of the AV7 follows first order kinetics, at a rate that is linearly dependent upon the UVA irradiance (0.30−3.26 mW cm−2). A comparison of relative rate of bleaching of the AV7 ink with the relative rate of removal of NO x, as determined using the ISO test (ISO 22197-1:2007), established a linear relationship between the two sets of results and the relevance of this correlation is discussed briefly.},

For the maltosides, the micellar solutions are shear thinning with a zero-shear viscosity that scales with concentration according to a power law with an exponent of about 5.8. In contrast, solutions of the glucosides C9G1, C10G1 and their mixtures show Newtonian flow behaviour and a much lower scaling exponent ({\textless}2.4). In C9G1/C10G1 mixtures, the scaling exponent decreases monotonously with increasing C10G1 content. The flow behaviour correlates with the packing requirements of the various surfactants, and are compatible with the idea that the maltosides form worm-like micelles, whereas the glucosides form branched, interconnected micelles (C9G1) and space-filling micellar networks (C10G1).},

We have measured the CMC, the partition coefficient, the effective mole fractions Xesatand Xesolat the onset and completion of the membrane-to-micelle transition (membrane solubilization), and the enthalpies of transfer of surfactant by ITC. Changes in membrane order and dynamics were characterized by time-resolved fluorescence anisotropy measurements of DPH, and micelle sizes and clouding by light scattering. The cosolvents have complex effects that are not governed by the well-known 'salting in' or 'salting out' effects on the solubility alone. Instead, urea and glycerol alter also the intrinsic curvature ('effective molecular shape') of the detergent and the order and packing of the membrane. These curvature effects have an unusual enthalpy/entropy balance and are not additive for lipid and detergent. The results shed light on the phenomena governing lipid-detergent systems in general and have a number of implications for the use of cosolvents in membrane protein studies. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

The unified scale is designed to provide a precise ratio, $\Xi$, of the resonance frequency of a given nuclide to that of the primary reference, the1H resonance of tetramethylsilane (TMS) in dilute solution (volume fraction, $\phi${\textless}1{\%}) in chloroform. Referencing procedures are discussed, including matters of practical application of the unified scale. Special attention is paid to recommended reference samples, and values of $\Xi$ for secondary references on the unified scale are listed, many of which are the results of new measurements. Some earlier recommendations relating to the reporting of chemical shifts are endorsed. The chemical shift, $\delta$, is redefined to avoid previous ambiguities but to leave practical usage unchanged. Relations between the unified scale and recently published recommendations for referencing in aqueous solutions (for specific use in biochemical work) are discussed, as well as the special effects of working in the solid state with magic-angle spinning. In all, nine new recommendations relating to chemical shifts are made. Standardised nuclear spin data are also presented in tabular form for the stable (and some unstable) isotopes of all elements with non-zero quantum numbers. The information given includes quantum numbers, isotopic abundances, magnetic moments, magnetogyric ratios, and receptivities, together with quadrupole moments and line-width factors (where appropriate).},

abstract = {A cationic surfactant and different anionic copolymers randomly grafted with side chains of ethylene oxide were used to prepare stoichiometric complex salts. Variations in the length or proportion of side chains were shown to be responsible for affecting the surfactant phase behavior in water, resulting in the observation of a number of structures characterized by small angle X-ray scattering measurements, including a hierarchical micellar system and different liquid-crystalline phases. Additionally, although aqueous mixtures of stoichiometric complex salts usually phase separate, the presence of a sufficiently high weight fraction of ethylene oxide side chains can enhance the solubility of the complex salt aggregates in water over a wide range of concentration.

abstract = {Cyclodextrins are a family of cyclic oligosaccharides composed of $\alpha$-(1,4) linked glucopyranose subunits. Cyclodextrins are useful molecular chelating agents. They possess a cage-like supramolecular structure, which is the same as the structures formed from cryptands, calixarenes, cyclophanes, spherands and crown ethers. These compounds having supramolecular structures carry out chemical reactions that involve intramolecular interactions where covalent bonds are not formed between interacting molecules, ions or radicals. The majority of all these reactions are of 'host-guest' type. Compared to all the supramolecular hosts mentioned above, cyclodextrins are most important. Because of their inclusion complex forming capability, the properties of the materials with which they complex can be modified significantly. As a result of molecular complexation phenomena CDs are widely used in many industrial products, technologies and analytical methods. The negligible cytotoxic effects of CDs are an important attribute in applications such as rug carrier, food and flavours, cosmetics, packing, textiles, separation processes, environment protection, fermentation and catalysis. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

The micelles grow in one dimension with increasing temp. and concn. DLS and viscometry data suggest that the micelle size reaches a max. at 60-70.degree.. Comparison of DLS data in D2O and H2O shows that the micelles are larger in the former case. The effect of salt on the micelle size was found to follow the Hofmeister series. Thus, at const. salt concn., the micelle size decreases according to the sequence SO42- {\textgreater} Cl- {\textgreater} NO3- {\textgreater} I- {\textgreater} SCN-, where I- and SCN- act as salting-in anions. From tensiometric data, it can be concluded that the temp. effects on micelle morphol. do not correlate directly with those on soly. Rather, the temp. effect on the hydrocarbon chain conformation seems to be decisive for the micelle morphol. At const. temp., on the other hand, the effect of salt and deuterium isotope is attributable to changes in effective head-group area, including intermol. interactions and water of hydration},

abstract = {Infrared studies of urea both in crystal and in water solution are presented. On the basis of temperature and concentration measurements of urea–water solutions, as well as from the spectra of crystalline urea films of hydrogenated and partially deuterated molecules, we have assigned the main bands in urea spectrum. It is shown that the series of spectra recorded at various concentrations in water can be decomposed into four basic spectra: the first one is the same as the spectrum of liquid water, the second one has features only due H2O but is slightly disturbed as compared with the first one and the other two display in addition features due to vibrations in urea. The relative intensities of these components show a strong concentration dependence, particularly for what concerns the ratio of the last two components. We ascribe one of these two components to a structure where urea–urea interaction is predominant in the solution while the other one is ascribed to a structure where spectral features are mainly due to urea–water interactions. The first component with urea–urea features can be observed only at urea concentrations higher than 1M. Concentration dependence of the population of these two components shows that at higher urea concentrations the interaction between urea molecules can be observed presumably as a consequence of aggregation of urea molecules. Such aggregation of urea molecules in dimers and/or oligomers may explain some peculiarities connected with the unusual behaviour of urea solutions in water as predicted by the Shellman, Kreschek, Scheraga and Stokes model. Concentration measurements also show that urea molecules only slightly alter the structure of bulk water, and hence cannot be described as ‘structure breakers'.},

abstract = {The dependence of alcohol chain length on the isothermal phase behavior of the ternary systems hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide/al- cohol/water has been investigated. A liquid crystalline phase (the normal hex- agonal one) occurs in the phase diagrams along the surfactant/water axis and this phase extends in the interior of the diagrams. When the alcohol is methanol, ethanol or butanol, there is in the ternary phase diagram a continuous solution region from the water to the alcoholic corner, and in the butanol case, in addition, a small region of lamellar liquid crystalline phase in the interior of the diagram. When the alcohol chain length is increased, the continuous solution region is divided into two subregions, an aqueous L 1 and an alcoholic L 2. The lamellar phase occupies the center of the phase diagrams and has the capability to incorporate large amounts of water under one-dimensional swelling. On the alcoholic side of the lamellar phase occur a reversed hexagonal liquid crystalline phase and a cubic liquid crystalline phase in the octanolic system; in the decanolic system the cubic phase is missing, but instead another liquid crystalline phase, presumably with rod-structure, occurs in addition to the reversed hexagonal phase. In a decanolic system where the monovalent bromide ion is replaced by the divalent sulphate ion there are the same solution regions L 1 and L2, and phase regions with liquid crystalline normal hexagonal and lamellar structures. The lamellar phase has lost much of its capability of incorporating water. That is in analogy with the conditions in anionic systems where the counterion charge has been increased. There is no reversed hexagonal phase, but on the alcoholic side of the lamellar phase, there is the same "foreign" liquid crystalline phase with a presumed rod-structure as in the monovalent system.},

The Maya drank balch{\'{e}} (a mixture of honey and extracts of Lonchocarpus) in group ceremonies to achieve intoxication. Ritual enemas and other psychoactive substances were also used to induce states of trance. Olmec, Zapotec, Maya and Aztec used peyote, hallucinogenic mushrooms (teonanacatl: Psilocybe spp) and the seeds of ololiuhqui (Turbina corymbosa), that contain mescaline, psilocybin and lysergic acid amide, respectively. The skin of the toad Bufo spp contains bufotoxins with hallucinogenic properties, and was used since the Olmec period. Jimson weed (Datura stramonium), wild tobacco (Nicotiana rustica), water lily (Nymphaea ampla) and Salvia divinorum were used for their psychoactive effects. Mushroom stones dating from 3000 BC have been found in ritual contexts in Mesoamerica. Archaeological evidence of peyote use dates back to over 5000 years. Several chroniclers, mainly Fray Bernardino de Sahag{\'{u}}n, described their effects in the sixteenth century.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: The use of psychoactive substances was common in pre-Columbian Mesoamerican societies.

abstract = {Surfactants are molecules able to spontaneously self-assemble to form aggregates with well-defined properties, such as spherical micelles, planar bilayers, cylindrical micelles or vesicles. Micelles have notably several applications in many domains, such as drug delivery or membrane protein solubilization. In this context, the study of micelle formation in relation with the structural and physico-chemical properties of surfactants is of great interest to better control their use in the different application fields. In this work, we use the MD approach developed by Yoshii et al. and extend it to surfactants with different structures. We aim to systematically investigate different micellar properties as a function of the aggregates size by a molecular dynamics approach, to get an insight into the micellar organization and to collect some relevant descriptors about micelle formation. For this, we perform short MD simulations of preformed micelles of various sizes and analyze three parameters for each micelle size, namely the eccentricity of the micelles, the hydrophobic/hydrophilic surface ratio and the hydrophobic tails hydration. If these parameters are known descriptors of micelles, they were not yet studied in this way by MD. We show that eccentricity, used as “validator” parameter, exhibits minimal values when the aggregate size is close to the experimental aggregation number for surfactants that are known to form spherical micelles. This hence indicates that our methodology gives consistent results. The evolution of the two descriptors follows another scheme, with a sharp increase and decrease, respectively, followed by a leveling-off. The aggregate sizes at which this stabilization starts to occur are close to the respective aggregation number of each surfactant. In our approach, we validate the use of these descriptors to follow micelle formation by MD, from “simple” surfactants to more complex structures, like lipopeptides. Our calculations also suggest that some peculiar behavior, like that of TPC, can be highlighted by our approach. In the context of peptidic surfactants, our methodology could further help to improve computer simulations combined to molecular thermodynamic models to predict micellar properties of those more complex amphiphilic molecules.},

abstract = {The physicochemical properties of a homologous series of sodium p-n-alkylbenzoates have been investigated. The objective was to determine whether there is a clear transition point from hydrotropic to surfactant-like behavior with increasing alkyl chain length n, so as to shed clear light on the aggregation mechanism of so-called "hydrotropes". Electrical conductivity measurements were used for a first estimation of the critical aggregation concentrations (cac). As for classical surfactants, log(cac) depends on alkyl chain length n, but two branches of behavior were observed: one having a gradient typical of long chain fatty acid salts and the other with a more shallow dependence. Surface tension ($\gamma$) measurements of high purity aqueous solutions were used to generate limiting headgroup areas A cac, which were in the range (40-50 {\AA} 2) being consistent with monolayer formation. Small-angle neutron scattering conclusively shows that the lower chain length homologues (classed as hydrotropes) exhibit sharp transitions in aggregation as a function of bulk concentration, typical of regular surfactants. As such, there is little to suggest from this study that hydrotropes differ in association behavior from regular surfactants. {\textcopyright} 2011 American Chemical Society.},

The concentration dependences of the scattered intensity and collective diffusion coefficient extrapolated to zero wave vector were found to follow the power laws derived for semidilute polymer solutions in good solvent.

It was established that DMSO create hydrogen bonds with water above DMSO molar fraction 0.1. The interaction between DMSO and mater molecules is stronger compared with interaction between water and polar head group of phospholipid membrane. This competition between DMSO and water in the interaction with membrane surface can explain the strong DMSO influence on the membrane structure and properties, which was established by small-angle neutron and X-ray scattering and DSC. With this approach, the DMSO-induced dehydration of the intermembrane space can be explained as a result of strong interaction between DMSO and water molecules. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {From catanionic fluoro-/hydro-carbon mixtures of fluoroacetic acid (CF3COOH) and tetradecyldimethylaminoxide (C14DMAO) in water, viscoelastic wormlike micelles are successfully constructed which are determined by cryo-TEM measurements. It is found that the formation and rheological behavior of the wormlike micelles are greatly affected by the total concentration and mixing ratio of CF3COOH and C14DMAO as well as temperature. The driving force for the formation of wormlike micelles here is considered to be the electrostatic attractive interaction between the two molecules which is confirmed by 1H NMR measurements. As far as we know, such wormlike micelles formed from the catanionic mixtures of fluorofatty acids and hydrocarbon surfactants have been rarely reported. Our work provides a simple method through mixing a perfluorofatty acid with a hydrocarbon surfactant to construct and understand the formation mechanism of catanionic fluoro-/hydro-carbon wormlike micelles, which should be a great advance in the fundamental research of wormlike micelles.},

Threetypes of counterions have been studied: (i) halides, (ii) alkanesulfonates, and (iii) aromatic counterions. The critical micelle concentration isfoundto decreasewithincreasing counterion sizeandincreasing counterion hydrophobicity, whereas the degree of counterion binding increases. The aggregation behavior of 1-methyl-4-n- dodecylpyridinium surfactants with aromatic counterions is shown to be markedly dependent on the substituent (hydrophobicity)andthe substitution pattern in the aromatic ring of the counterion. Depending on the molecular architecture of the aromatic counterion, extremely long wormlike micelles can be formed instead of (nearly) spherical micelles. NMRexperiments revealed that all aromatic counterions intercalate in between the pyridinium headgroups of the micelles, with more or less the same degree of penetration. All results can be explained on the basis of counterion-surfactant and counterion-water interactions, taking into account the specific microenvironment in the Stern layer.},

The dependence of the rheological longest relaxation time ($\tau$m) on a molar ratio of pTS-relative to that of Sal-in the interior of threadlike micelles was mainly discussed.

Recent developments in the scientific study of religious beliefs and behaviors point to the conclusion that religious disbelief arises from multiple interacting pathways, traceable to cognitive, motivational, and cultural learning mechanisms. We identify four such pathways, leading to four distinct forms of atheism, which we term mindblind atheism, apatheism, inCREDulous atheism, and analytic atheism. Religious belief and disbelief share the same underlying pathways and can be explained within a single evolutionary framework that is grounded in both genetic and cultural evolution. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

Reversible aggregate transitions from spherical micelles to wormlike micelles, vesicles, and back to wormlike micelles and spherical micelles are successfully realized through fine regulation over the mixing ratio of surfactants, i.e., the anionic/cationic charge ratio. The five aggregate regions display distinguished phase boundaries so that the aggregate regions can be well controlled. From thermodynamic aspect, the ITC curves clearly reflect all the aggregate transitions and the related interaction mechanism. The self-assembling ability of the C(12)C(3)C(12)(SO(3))(2)/CTAB mixtures are significantly improved compared with both individual surfactants. Micelle growth from spherical to long wormlike micelles takes place at a relative low total concentration, i.e., 2.0 mM. The wormlike micelle solution at 10 mM or higher shows high viscosity and shear thinning property. Moreover, the C(12)C(3)C(12)(SO(3))(2)/CTAB mixtures do not precipitate even at 1:1 charge ratio and relative high concentration. It suggests that applying gemini surfactant should be an effective approach to improve the solubility of anionic/cationic surfactant mixtures and in turn may promote applications of the surfactant mixtures.},

This substitution allowed us to produce asymmetric bolaform surfactants that form micellar solutions at room temperature. It is reasoned that the proximity of the bromide counterion to the quaternary ammonium center stabilizes the hydrated crystal of the conventional and bolaform surfactants through Coulombic interactions. The bolaform surfactants experience further stabilization as a result of bonding between the hydroxyl functionality and the quaternary nitrogen and bromide. Substitution of ethyl for methyl groups in the headgroup increases the ion-ion and ion-dipole distances, lowering the stability of the hydrated crystal, which in turn lowers the Krafft temperature.},

The combined use of1H and NOESY techniques revealed that phenol has different preferred locations of interaction depending on the pH. At neutral pH (6.70) conditions, phenol molecules are preferentially located in the outer micelle region, at the micelle-water interface, while at more basic pH (9.94), the deprotonated phenol molecules (C6H5O-) are immersed into the palisade layer of the micelle. In addition, quantitative estimates of the solubilized fraction of phenol were obtained by using PFG-NMR. The results indicate that the phenol-CTAB interactions, although already present in neutral pH conditions, are largely favored in basic conditions as a consequence of the strong electrostatic interaction between the negatively charged phenolate ions and the positive charge of the cationic surfactant head group. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

Using an 80 kVp photon beam, the effect of GNP on the dose deposition in five modeled regions of the cell including cytoplasm, membrane, and nucleus was simulated. Two Geant4 physics lists were tested: the default Livermore and custom built Livermore/DNA hybrid physics list. 10(6) particles were simulated at 840 cells in the simulation. Each cell was randomly placed with random orientation and a diameter varying between 9 and 13 $\mu$m. A mathematical algorithm was used to ensure that none of the 840 cells overlapped. The energy dependence of the GNP physical dose enhancement effect was calculated by simulating the dose deposition in the cells with two energy spectra of 80 kVp and 6 MV. The contribution from Auger electrons was investigated by comparing the two GNP simulation scenarios while activating and deactivating atomic de-excitation processes in Geant4.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: The physical dose enhancement ratio (DER) of GNP was calculated using the Monte Carlo model. The model has demonstrated that the DER depends on the amount of gold and the position of the gold cluster within the cell. Individual cell regions experienced statistically significant (p {\textless} 0.05) change in absorbed dose (DER between 1 and 10) depending on the type of gold geometry used. The DER resulting from gold clusters attached to the cell nucleus had the more significant effect of the two cases (DER ≈ 55). The DER value calculated at 6 MV was shown to be at least an order of magnitude smaller than the DER values calculated for the 80 kVp spectrum. Based on simulations, when 80 kVp photons are used, Auger electrons have a statistically insignificant (p {\textless} 0.05) effect on the overall dose increase in the cell. The low energy of the Auger electrons produced prevents them from propagating more than 250-500 nm from the gold cluster and, therefore, has a negligible effect on the overall dose increase due to GNP.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: The results presented in the current work show that the primary dose enhancement is due to the production of additional photoelectrons.},

abstract = {Colloidal systems are important across a range of industries, such as the food, pharmaceutical, agrochemical, cosmetics, polymer, paint and oil industries, and form the basis of a wide range of products (eg cosmetics {\&} toiletries, processed foodstuffs and photographic film). A detailed understanding of their formation, control and application is required in those industries, yet many new graduate or postgraduate chemists or chemical engineers have little or no direct experience of colloids. This book is based on lectures given at the highly successful Bristol Colloid Centre Spring School, designed to provide a thorough introduction to colloid science for industrial chemists, technologists and engineers. The course has attracted a wide range of industrialists from major companies with over 1000 delegates attending in all. This book brings together the BCC Spring School lectures and presents them in a coherent and logical text on practical colloid science. The authors are well known internationally in their respective fields and the book will be uniquely focussed on providing the reader with a detailed understanding of the practical application of colloid science. {\textcopyright} 2005 Bristol Colloid Centre.},

abstract = {Amphiphile lyotropic liquid crystalline self-assembly materials are being used for a diverse range of applications. Historically, the most studied lyotropic liquid crystalline phase is probably the one-dimensional (1-D) lamellar phase, which has been employed as a model system for biomembranes and for drug delivery applications. In recent years, the structurally more complex 2-D and 3-D ordered lyotropic liquid crystalline phases, of which reversed hexagonal (H2) and reversed cubic phases (v2) are two prominent examples, have received growing interest. As is the case for the lamellar phase, these phases are frequently stable in excess water, which facilitates the preparation of nanoparticle dispersions and makes them suitable candidates for the encapsulation and controlled release of drugs. Integral membrane protein crystallization media and templates for the synthesis of inorganic nanostructured materials are other applications for 2-D and 3-D amphiphile self-assembly materials. The number of amphiphiles identified as forming nanostructured reversed phases stable in excess solvent is rapidly growing. In this article, different classes of amphiphiles that form reversed phases in excess solvent are reviewed, with an emphasis on linking phase behavior to amphiphile structure. The different amphiphile classes include: ethylene oxide-, monoacylglycerol-, glycolipid-, phosphatidylethanolamine-, and urea-based amphiphiles.},

abstract = {The pH-responsive behavior of an amino acid is used to control the electrostatic interactions on a cationic micelle surface and thereby alter the morphology of self-assembled structures formed by them. The pH-induced changes in the rheology and microstructure in an aqueous mixture of cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) and a hydrophobic amino acid mimic, anthranilic acid (AA) were studied by rheological measurements, small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) and light scattering. At low pH, when the net charge on the amino acid is positive, nearly globular mixed micelles are formed. With increase in pH, the AA becomes negatively charged due to the dissociation of carboxyl group and complexes with the positively charged CTAB molecule. This electrostatic complexation decreases the surface charge of the micelles, leading to a structural evolution from small globular micelles to long worm-like assemblies. Rheological studies indicate a transition from Newtonian to viscoelastic nature of the fluid with an increase in the pH of the solution. SANS studies confirm the formation of prolate ellipsoidal micelles and the axial ratio of the micelle increases with an increase in pH of the solution. The variation in the diffusion coefficient of the micelles with pH is consistent with the SANS results. This demonstrates the use of hydrophobic amino acids in creating pH-sensitive assemblies of amphiphiles. An increase in the zero shear viscosity of the fluid of four orders of magnitude could be achieved by a slight change in the pH of the solution},

The31P NMR solution study, confirms the structural features observed in the solid state and, in addition, indicates partial formation of dinuclear cationic [Au(tBu3P)2]+and [Au(dppet)2]+species. The ionic character and strong Au-P bonds of this gold(I) species are similar to those of the most active antitumor gold compounds so far studied. The title compound was found to exhibit strong cytotoxicity, showing 85 fold greater toxicity than cisplatin (IC50= 0.45 $\mu$M vs IC50= 39.16 for cisplatin at 24 h) on the HCT-116 line. The cytotoxic effects were, at least partly, mediated by the induction of apoptotic cell death as evidenced by the sub-G1cell accumulation, oligonucleosomal DNA fragmentation, caspase-3 activation and the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria. The gold(I) compound showed little interaction with DNA measured through fluorescence quenching studies with calf thymus DNA. The inhibitory effect of the gold(I) compound on intracellular redox proteins has been also observed in pretreated HCT-116 cells. The compound was particularly effective in inhibiting thioredoxin reductase, that is likely responsible for the increased ROS production, and subsequent apoptosis induction via the mitochondrial pathway. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {A novel pH-switchable anionic wormlike micellar system has been developed by simply changing pH value of natural erucic acid solutions without needing specialized organic synthesis or addition of hydrotropes. Through rheology, optical transmittance, and cryo-TEM observation, it was found that at 60 °C, the 100. mM erucic acid solutions transform from low viscous emulsion-like fluids to viscoelastic hydrogels when the pH is increased from 8.03 to 12.35, and when the pH is cycled between 9.02 and 12.35, the viscosity of the solutions varies correspondingly between 2 and 200,000. mPa. s, five orders of magnitude in viscosity range. Such a reversible switch can be easily cycled more than four times without any deterioration. In addition, when the pH is fixed between 9.0 and 12.35, the solutions shift to highly elastic solid-like gels with decreasing temperature. These pH-switchable and temperature-sensitive rheological properties are attributed to the presence of carboxylic groups in the erucic acid molecules. With increasing pH, erucic acid is converted into an anionic surfactant, sodium erucate, which self-assembles into aggregates evolving from spherical micelles to wormlike micelles; when temperature is decreased, these disordered micellar structures become highly ordered under the effect of crystallization of hydrophobic erucate chains, forming opaque solid-like hydrogels. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

The urea-induced effects investigated are increases in amphiphile critical micelle concentrations, ionization degrees (alpha), and aggregation numbers; decreases in percolation thresholds of reversed micelles; expansion of minimum areas of monolayers; increases in the radii of gyration of polyelectrolytes; changes in morphologies of sodium bis-2-ethylhexylsulfosuccinate thin films on glass substrates; and direct evidence for urea-induced reduction in ion pairing. All of these effects are attributed to an urea-induced enhancement of the hydrophilic properties of water that results in more strongly solvated polar groups and ions and a. reduction in ion pair formation. The implications of this analysis for urea effects on protein 3-D structure are briefly highlighted.},

abstract = {In this work, the recipes of this book have been frequently used. However, a great deal of new information has been produced with respect to iron oxide synthesis, particularly regarding ultrafine iron oxides and those with different morphologies. We have taken these developments into account in the second edition. As before, our main aim was to provide reliable, well tested recipes for the synthesis of pure iron oxides. In addition, all chapters have been re- vised and new data added. In the initial, general chapters we have ex- panded the section on monodispersed particles, currently of great interest to industry and offered some illustration of such products. The methods of characterization have been focused on their relevance to iron oxides and for general aspects of these methods, the reader is referred to stan- dard treatises. The chapter on color, which is of paramount importance for iron oxides, has been enlarged to incorporate recent advances in this field.},

abstract = {The persistence length of a wormlike micelle composed of ionic surfactants C(n)E(m)X(k) in an aqueous solvent is predicted by means of the self-consistent-field theory where C(n)E(m) is the conventional nonionic surfactant and X(k) is an additional sequence of k weakly charged (pH-dependent) segments. By considering a toroidal micelle at infinitesimal curvature, we evaluate the bending modulus of the wormlike micelle that corresponds to the total persistence length, consisting of an elastic/intrinsic and an electrostatic contribution. The total persistence length increases with pH and decreases with increasing background salt concentration. We estimate that the electrostatic persistence length l(p,e)(0) scales with respect to the Debye length kappa(-1) as l(p,e)(0) approximately kappa(-p) where p approximately 1.98 for wormlike micelles consisting of C(20)E(10)X(1) surfactants and p approximately 1.54 for wormlike micelles consisting of C(20)E(10)X(2) surfactants. The total persistence length l(p,t)(0) is a weak function of the head group length m but scales with the tail length n as l(p,t)(0) approximately n(x) where x approximately 2-2.6, depending on the corresponding head group length. Interestingly, l(p,t)(0) varies nonmonotonically with the number of charged groups k due to the opposing trends in the electrostatic and elastic bending rigidities upon variation of k.},

The comparison between the experimental data and the recent results of a computer simulation provides an estimate of tau(break), the time taken for a micelle of the mean length to break. The measured concentration dependences of rheological and kinetic parameters suggest that intermicellar branching occurs at high salt content. An analysis of the data using the recent results of a Poisson renewal model leads to the determination of a characteristic length, identified as the ratio of the total length over the sum of the end-caps density and of twice the connections density. The nonlinear behavior of the investigated systems is in good agreement with the recent theoretical predictions of Cates et al. as long as the stress relaxation of the system does not depart too much from a single exponential.},

abstract = {The pH-responsive behavior of an amino acid is used to control the electrostatic interactions on a cationic micelle surface and thereby alter the morphology of self-assembled structures formed by them. The pH-induced changes in the rheology and microstructure in an aqueous mixture of cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) and a hydrophobic amino acid mimic, anthranilic acid (AA) were studied by rheological measurements, small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) and light scattering. At low pH, when the net charge on the amino acid is positive, nearly globular mixed micelles are formed. With increase in pH, the AA becomes negatively charged due to the dissociation of carboxyl group and complexes with the positively charged CTAB molecule. This electrostatic complexation decreases the surface charge of the micelles, leading to a structural evolution from small globular micelles to long worm-like assemblies. Rheological studies indicate a transition from Newtonian to viscoelastic nature of the fluid with an increase in the pH of the solution. SANS studies confirm the formation of prolate ellipsoidal micelles and the axial ratio of the micelle increases with an increase in pH of the solution. The variation in the diffusion coefficient of the micelles with pH is consistent with the SANS results. This demonstrates the use of hydrophobic amino acids in creating pH-sensitive assemblies of amphiphiles. An increase in the zero shear viscosity of the fluid of four orders of magnitude could be achieved by a slight change in the pH of the solution},

abstract = {The effect of different hydrotropic salts on the microenvironment at the anionic head group region of sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) micelle has been studied through time-resolved fluorescence anisotropy measurements of a solubilized probe, coumarin-153 (C153). The organic cations of the hydrotropic salts used in this study, i.e. aniline hydrochloride (AHC) and o-, m- and p-toluidine hydrochlorides (OTHC, MTHC and PTHC, respectively), differ in their charge to size ratio and hydrophobicity. Present study utilizes the sensitivity of the fluorescence technique to understand the changes in the micropolarity and microviscosity experienced by the fluorescent probe, C153, solubilized in the micellar Stern layer, on addition of different hydrotropic salts. Significant changes are observed in the rotational relaxation dynamics of the probe with increasing concentration of the salts. The changes in the rotational relaxation dynamics clearly reflect the sphere to rod transition in the SDS micelles and correspond nicely with the reported results from dynamic light scattering measurements. The growth behavior of SDS micelles is found to be sensitive to the hydrophobicity of the organic cations. The charge to size ratio of the organic cations also indicated to play a role in inducing the sphere to rod transition in the SDS micelles. The interesting observation made from this study is that the sphere to rod transition of SDS micelles is largely facilitated by the presence of the hydrotropic salts and such a transition is successfully indicated by the simple fluorescence anisotropy measurements of a probe in the micelle carried out in the presence of different hydrotropic salts. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {We report our investigations into the self-assembly of sodium oleate (NaOA) in the presence of a binding salt (triethylammonium chloride, Et(3)NHCl) simple salt (potassium chloride, KCl). Both salts promote the growth of long, wormlike micelles in NaOA solutions, thereby increasing the fluid viscosity. The significant difference with the Et(3)NHCl salt is that it also modifies the phase behavior of NaOA solutions. Specifically, NaOA/Et(3)NHCl solutions display cloud points upon heating, followed by phase separation into two liquid phases. Such cloud point behavior is rarely observed in ionic surfactant systems, although it is common in nonionic surfactant solutions. Interestingly, while cloud points are not observed with KCl, the addition of KCl to NaOA/Et(3)NHCl solutions further lowers the cloud point temperature. Also, in the case of tetraethylammonium halide salt, neither a cloud point nor an increase in viscosity is observed. The clouding in the case of Et(3)NHCl is attributed to the temperature-induced aggregation of anionic micelles whose surface is covered by bound counterions.},

@article{Srinivasan2003a,
abstract = {A molecular?thermodynamic theory is developed to model the micellization of ionic surfactants with added electrolytes in aqueous solution, by combining a thermodynamic description of the micellar solution free energy with a molecular model of the micellization process. The molecular model of micellization, which accounts for the various free-energy contributions associated with assembling the charged micelle from its constituent surfactant ions, allows for a fraction of the counterions, released by the surfactant heads and/or any added electrolytes, to bind onto the micelle surface and effectively induce a partial reduction of the micelle surface charge. The bound counterions are modeled as being intercalated among the surfactant heads on the micelle surface of charge. The remaining counterions are distributed according to the Boltzmann equation in the diffuse region, which lies beyond the Stern layer of steric exclusion adjacent to the micelle surface of charge. Expressions for the various free-energy contributions to micelle formation are derived for the general case when multiple counterion species are present in the solution, including inorganic counterions, such as Na+, as well as organic counterions having pendant hydrophobic groups that penetrate into the micelle core, such as the salicylate ion. In our theoretical formulation, the optimal degree of binding of each counterion species onto the charged micelle surface is a predicted quantity, obtained by minimizing the free energy of micelle formation, and depends on the nature of the counterion, including its hydrated size, valence, and lipophilicity. The theory developed is validated by implementing it in the case of the well-studied ionic surfactant system:? sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) with added NaCl. We find good quantitative agreement between our theoretical predictions of (i) the optimal degree of Na+ binding onto the charged micelle surface, (ii) the electrostatic potential at the micelle surface of charge, (iii) the electrostatic potential at the Stern surface, and (iv) the critical micelle concentration (cmc) and the available experimental results for these properties. In addition, the optimal degree of counterion binding is predicted to vary with the bulk electrolyte concentration and with the micelle shape, consistent with the experimentally observed variations of the counterion concentration in the micelle?water interfacial region. In paper 2 of this series, the molecular?thermodynamic theory developed here is utilized to predict various micellar solution properties, including the cmc, the optimal degree of counterion binding, and the average micelle aggregation numbers, of aqueous solutions of ionic surfactants containing monovalent, multivalent, and/or organic counterions. A molecular?thermodynamic theory is developed to model the micellization of ionic surfactants with added electrolytes in aqueous solution, by combining a thermodynamic description of the micellar solution free energy with a molecular model of the micellization process. The molecular model of micellization, which accounts for the various free-energy contributions associated with assembling the charged micelle from its constituent surfactant ions, allows for a fraction of the counterions, released by the surfactant heads and/or any added electrolytes, to bind onto the micelle surface and effectively induce a partial reduction of the micelle surface charge. The bound counterions are modeled as being intercalated among the surfactant heads on the micelle surface of charge. The remaining counterions are distributed according to the Boltzmann equation in the diffuse region, which lies beyond the Stern layer of steric exclusion adjacent to the micelle surface of charge. Expressions for the various free-energy contributions to micelle formation are derived for the general case when multiple counterion species are present in the solution, including inorganic counterions, such as Na+, as well as organic counterions having pendant hydrophobic groups that penetrate into the micelle core, such as the salicylate ion. In our theoretical formulation, the optimal degree of binding of each counterion species onto the charged micelle surface is a predicted quantity, obtained by minimizing the free energy of micelle formation, and depends on the nature of the counterion, including its hydrated size, valence, and lipophilicity. The theory developed is validated by implementing it in the case of the well-studied ionic surfactant system:? sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) with added NaCl. We find good quantitative agreement between our theoretical predictions of (i) the optimal degree of Na+ binding onto the charged micelle surface, (ii) the electrostatic potential at the micelle surface of charge, (iii) the electrostatic potential at the Stern surface, and (iv) the critical micelle concentration (cmc) and the available experimental results for these properties. In addition, the optimal degree of counterion binding is predicted to vary with the bulk electrolyte concentration and with the micelle shape, consistent with the experimentally observed variations of the counterion concentration in the micelle?water interfacial region. In paper 2 of this series, the molecular?thermodynamic theory developed here is utilized to predict various micellar solution properties, including the cmc, the optimal degree of counterion binding, and the average micelle aggregation numbers, of aqueous solutions of ionic surfactants containing monovalent, multivalent, and/or organic counterions.},

abstract = {We have experimentally studied the rheological behaviour of an aqueous cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) solution with sodium salicylate (NaSal) as added salt. The CTAB concentration C(D) was fixed at 0.1 M, and in this work we observe the evolution of the linear and non-linear rheological behaviour of the solution when the salt concentration C(S) is below or equal to C(D), varying between 0.015 and 0.1 M. We observe two very different kinds of behaviours. For the low C(S) concentration, we can obtain a shear-thickening effect. The critical shear rate at which this occurs is a function of the temperature T, and C(S). We give here the evolution of this critical parameter. When C(S) increases and reaches a limit value, this behaviour disappears and we obtain a shear-thinning effect with a shear stress plateau for a certain range of shear rate. In the plateau domain an induced shear-banding structure must exist: bands of high and low shear rate co-exist under flow.},

The mole fraction dependence of all these thermodynamic functions was used to elucidate the effect of glycerol on the molecular organization of H2O. The glycerol molecules do not exert a hydrophobic effect on H2O. Rather, the hydroxyl groups of glycerol, perhaps by forming clusters via its alkyl backbone with hydroxyl groups pointing outward, interact with H2O so as to reduce the characteristics of liquid H2O. The global hydrogen bond probability and, hence, the percolation nature of the hydrogen bond network is reduced. In addition, the degree of fluctuation inherent in liquid H2O is reduced by glycerol perhaps by participating in the hydrogen bond network via OH groups. At infinite dilution, the pair interaction coefficients in enthalpy were evaluated and these data suggest a possibility that the interaction is mediated through H2O.},

abstract = {Poly [(L-histidine)-co-(L-phenylalanine)]-block-poly (ethylene glycol) (HF-b-PEG) diblock copolymers were synthesized to be used for preparation of pH-sensitive polymeric micelles. First, HF block was synthesized by ring opening copolymerization of L-histidine and L-phenylalanine N-carboxyanhydride, and then the resulting copolymer was coupled with PEG. The pKa value of diblock copolymer can be controlled by adjusting the histidine/phenylalanine ratio in HF block. It is observed that the block copolymers form micelles in aqueous media and that the micelles are spherical in shape with a unimodal distribution. The micelle is formed at pH higher than pKa of block copolymer while it is not formed at lower pH. This is because the protonation of histidine residue in the HF block converts the hydrophobic core into hydrophilic one at lower pH. {\textcopyright} 2005 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH {\&} Co. KGaA.},

The enthalpies of micelle formation for these surfactants were positive at 288.15 K and decreased with increasing temperature to ultimately become negative above 308.15 K. The CMC of the amino acid surfactants decreased monotonously with increasing hydrophobicity of the amino acid residue without exception, while with the exception of the C12Phe system, the enthalpy of micelle formation increased. The micellization behavior of C12Phe also deviated from that of other amino acid systems in terms of the heat capacity and the aggregation number.

Analytical characterizations of the complexes were based on elemental (C, H, N and S), thermal (TG-DTA) and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) analyses. Solid-state13C nuclear magnetic resonance (SSNMR) and infrared (IR) spectroscopic measurements indicate coordination of Pen to Ag(I) or Au(I) through the sulfur atom. Studies based on density functional theory (DFT) confirmed that Pen acts as an S-donor ligand to Au(I) or Ag(I). Thermal decompositions of the silver(I) and gold(I) complexes start at temperatures near 50 °C, leading to the formation of Ag0and Au0at 700 °C and 500 °C, respectively. Both complexes are just slightly soluble in common solvents such as water, methanol, ethanol, acetonitrile, hexane and dimethylsulfoxide.

abstract = {This review covers the effects of hydrophobic counterions on the phase behavior of ionic surfactants and the properties of the phases. Mixing hydrophobic counterions with ionic surfactant micellar solutions may initiate the micellar growth and transform the micellar microstructure into different morphologies. This behavior may also be achieved by mixing ionic surfactants with hydrophilic counterions, although higher counterionic concentrations are then required. First, the role of hydrophilic and hydrophobic counterions in regards to micelle growth is discussed. Second, the effect of the hydrophobic counterion on the self-assembly of cationic and anionic surfactants and their viscoelastic behavior are presented. Third, the relationships between geometry, hydrophobicity and their consequences on micellar growth for different hydrophobic counterions are reviewed. Forth, the influence of hydrophobic counterion substituents (substitution pattern) on the phase behavior is discussed. Some results we previously obtained for different isomers of hydroxy naphthaoic acids and the cationic surfactant cetyltrimethylammonium hydroxide are included. With these systems the effect that the hydrophobic counterion microenvironment has on the phase behavior, rheological behavior and the micellar microstructure is discussed. The results from other research groups are also discussed. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

The precipitate was resolubilized by further addition of aluminum salt ({\textgreater}5wt.{\%} Al(NO3)3). Using the time-resolved fluorescence quenching method and employing pyrene- decylpyridinium chloride as probe-quencher pair, the aggregation numbers and fluorescence quenching rates for spherical micelles were determined. Fluorescence measurements give evidence for different kind of micelles in the two isotropic areas investigated. At low aluminum salt concentration, the micelles are relatively small, but larger than in the absence of salt. At high enough salt concentrations, the precipitate is resolubilized into long rod-like micelles. The strong viscoelastic properties in the linear regime supported the presence of worm-like micelles in the redissolution area. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

The surface potential measurements were based on the well established technique of using micelle-solubilized acid-base indicators. Free monomer concentrations were determined from results obtained using the mixed micelle critical micelle concentrations and then processing this information using a nonideal mixed micelle theory. For the systems studied it has been found that a change in the modulus of the surface potential per unit change in log(ionic surfactant concentration) is approximately 59 mV. This is in accordance with the Nernstian relationship put forward by Healy et al.1 linking the electrostatic surface potential of a charged micelle to the equilibrium monomer concentration.},

The simulation results presented the different terminal structures of the cylindrical (rod-like) micelles. According to the critical packing parameters of the micellar stability theory, the microscopic structures of cylindrical (or rod-like) micelles with different endcaps were analyzed. The shorter rod-like micelle was constituted by the cylindrical body and two swelling spherical endcaps, while the longer cylindrical (or rod-like) micelle had two spherical crown endcaps less than the hemisphere. The models of the cylindrical (rod-like) micelles were presented in detail based on the simu lation results and the micellar stability theory.},

abstract = {The behavior of magnetically responsive aqueous Fe(III) surfactant solutions at liquid interfaces is analyzed. Such surfactants attracted much attention, because of the ability to manipulate interfaces by magnetic ﬁelds without any use of magnetic nanoparticles. A detailed analysis of the surface properties proves that the mixing of paramagnetic electrolyte solution with anionic, cationic and nonionic surfactants yields the similar magnetic response and no effect of the surfactant charge can be observed. We conclude that the observed magnetic shiftability of interfaces is caused by a combination of the paramagnetic behavior of the bulk liquid and a reduction of the surface tension. Thus, this work gives an alternative interpretation of the properties of "magnetic surfactants" compared to the ones claimed in the literature.},

The self-assembly of the aliphatic biodegradable copolyester PBS/PBDL (poly(butylene succinate-co-butylene dilinoleate)) and HPMA-based copolymers (N-(2-hydroxypropyl)methacrylamide-based copolymers) hydrophobically modified by the incorporation of cholesterol led to the formation of narrow-size- distributed (PDI {\textless} 0.10) sub-200-nm polymeric nanoparticles suitable for passive tumor-targeting drug delivery based on the size-dependent EPR (enhanced permeability and retention) effect. The PHPMA provided to the self-assembled nanoparticle stability against aggregation as evaluated in vitro. The highly hydrophobic drug docetaxel (DTXL) was physically entrapped within the PBS/PBDL copolyester core and the hydrophilic drug doxorubicin hydrochloride (DOX{\textperiodcentered}HCl) was chemically conjugated to the reactive PHPMA copolymer shell via hydrazone bonding that allowed its pH-sensitive release. This strategy enabled the combination chemotherapy by the simultaneous DOX and DTXL drug delivery. The structure of the nanoparticles was characterized in detail using static (SLS), dynamic (DLS) and electrophoretic (ELS) light scattering besides transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The use of nanoparticles simultaneously loaded with DTXL and DOX provided a more efficient suppression of tumor-cell growth in mice bearing EL-4 T cell lymphoma when compared to the effect of nanoparticles loaded with either DTXL or DOX separately. Additionally, the obtained self-assembled nanoparticles enable further development of targeting strategies based on the use of multiple ligands attached to an HPMA copolymer on the particle surface for simultaneous passive and active targeting and different combination therapies. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

Light scattering, viscosity and cryo-transmission electronic microscopy (cryo-TEM) results revealed that the aggregates transferred from spherical micelles to vesicles (MVT) via wormlike micelles as the pH was gradually varied from acidic to basic conditions. pH-dependent zeta potential and1H NMR studies confirmed these transitions. Interestingly, the formed wormlike micelles could transform into vesicles upon heating, which was studied by cryo-TEM, light scattering and viscosity techniques in detail. It is concluded that the pH and thermal MVT are a general phenomenon in all three amphiphiles investigated.

abstract = {Small micellar aggregates of some surfactants exhibit enormous growth in one dimension and form very long and flexible wormlike micelles. Depending on the nature of the surfactant, such micellar growth can be induced in different ways, for example by adding cosurfactants or salts. Above a system-dependent concentration of surfactant, these giant micelles are entangled to form a transient network, and exhibit viscoelastic behavior analogous to a flexible polymer solution. However, unlike polymers in solutions, wormlike micelles undergo breaking and recombination, and, therefore, exhibit complex rheological behavior. Information on the evolution of aggregate morphology can be obtained from rheological study. In this article formation of wormlike micelles and the evolution of rheological properties in different mixed surfactant systems is discussed. Besides, a brief overview on the salt-induced micellar growth in ionic surfactant systems and reverse micellar systems induced by adding certain polar additives has also been presented. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Light-scattering measurements at the critical concentration for phase separation show that the osmotic compressibility and the correlation range of concentration fluctuations diverge as the critical point is approached in all the investigated systems. The results concerning short-chain amphiphiles (C6E3, CsE,) strongly suggest that the observed behavior is due to critical concentration fluctuations and that the phase transition is due to interactions among small globular micelles. The results concerning long-chain amphiphiles (CIZE8, CI4E7) indicate that, besides critical effects, there may be some micellar growth with temperature. It is suggested that this second effect, if existing, is connected to the presence of anisotropic-phase boundaries not too far from the critical concentration line.},

abstract = {The influence of ionic charges on the mesophases in the ternary system of C(12-16)E(6) (LA 070), ethylhexylglycerid (EHG), and water was studied. The charge was introduced by adding the ionic surfactant SDS (sodium dodecyl sulfate). The single lamellar phase (5 wt {\%} LA 070 and 240 mM EHG in water) yields a bluish homogeneous solution. With the addition of SDS, the samples become more and more clear. Rheology measurements indicate that increased charge density increases the storage modulus G', and the lamellar phases show typical behavior of a viscoelastic fluid with a yield stress at higher SDS concentration. SAXS measurements show that the interlamellar distance D decreases with SDS concentration. The addition of ionic surfactants suppresses the Helfrich undulations, flattens the bilayers, and decreases interbilayer spacing due to electrostatic repulsions of the ionic surfactant head groups. Furthermore, the L(alpha) phase transforms into vesicle phases as the SDS concentration is increased. Second, it is shown that with added NaCl electrolyte the phase with charged surfactant behaves again in the same way as the initial uncharged system. The addition of salt screens the electrostatic interaction, which leads to a higher flexibility of the bilayers and a decrease of the storage modulus G'. Theoretical calculations show that the shear moduli of the L(alpha) phases are much smaller than the osmotic pressure of the systems. Several models are proposed for the explanation of the shear moduli. The model due to Lekkerkerker for the electric contribution of the bending constant of the bilayer seems to yield good results for the transition to vesicles.},

Results are obtained concerning the capacity of the surfactants to lower surface tension, the rate of lowering, the extent of adsorption at the interface, the possibility of changing conformation during and after adsorption, and the interactions between the adsorbed molecules. A time-dependent synergy is observed in most of the mixtures, while in a few cases hindrance effects are observed. The interaction of HPMC with the double chain cationic surfactants resulted in complexes with higher surface activity than the two components alone. Two induction times were observed, the second ones being more significant in the presence of di-TDAB.

abstract = {Highly concentrated micelles in CTAB/NaSal solutions with a fixed salt/surfactant ratio of 0.6 have been studied using Small Angle Neutron Scattering (SANS) as a function of temperature and concentration. A worm-like chain model analysis of the SANS data using a combination of a cylindrical form factors for the polydisperse micellar length, circular cross-sectional radius with Gaussian polydispersity, and the structure factor based on a random phase approximation (RPA) suggests that these micelle solutions have a worm-like micellar structure that is independent of the concentration and temperature. The size of the micelle decreases monotonically with increasing temperature and increases with concentration. These observations indicate that large micelles are formed at low temperature and begin to break up to form smaller micelles with increasing temperature.},

The data are analyzed in detail in terms of the number-averaged contour length, assuming an exponential size distribution, as predicted by theory, and that the micellar flexibility can be described by the wormlike chain model with a certain persistence length. A very good agreement between the different experimental methods is obtained. The number-averaged contour length increases with increasing micelle volume fraction. The data are consistent with a power law, where the power law exponent is in the range 0.5-0.8, depending on the system. The result is in reasonable agreement with the theory of living polymers.},

In this study, adopting Coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulation, the conformational transformation was studied in a binary system of cetyltrimethylammonium chloride (CTAC) and sodium salicylate (Nasal). A gross conformation diagram of micelle at different CTAC concentrations and molar ratios of CTAC/Nasal indicates that the branched structure could form at zeta potential lower than 32 mV. Further, the dynamic process displays that four sequential stages, approaching, forming salt bridge, yielding stalk, and coalescing together, involve in this transformation. And a fascinating process, an organic salt bridge first form between two approaching micelles and then induces the surfactant jump out to form stalk, was observed. In addition, some rational strategies were proposed to reduce the probability of this conformational transformation. Our study provides a molecular-level understanding of transformation behaviour from linear to branched wormlike micelles.},

abstract = {A mol. theory for the formation of mixed micelles is developed as an extension of an earlier theory for single-component micelles. The theory permits the calcn. of the cmc, the av. micelle size, and the av. micelle compn. as well as the size and the compn. distribution of micelles in mixed surfactant systems. Central to the theory is an explicit mol. thermodn. expression for the Gibbs energy of formation of the mixed micelle. This Gibbs energy of micelle formation, which is compn. dependent, can be decompd. into bulk and interfacial components. The bulk component includes the free energy contributions arising from the transfer of the surfactant tail from H2O to the micelle. The interfacial component includes the free energy contributions due to the micellar core-H2O interfacial energy, the steric repulsions between the head groups at the micelle surface, and the electrostatic repulsions between the head groups at the micelle surface. If the Gibbs energy of micelle formation is a linear function of the micelle compn., then the excess Gibbs energy is 0 and the surfactant mixt. behaves ideally. On the other hand, if the Gibbs energy of micelle formation has a nonlinear dependence on the micelle compn., then the excess Gibbs energy is nonzero and the surfactant mixt. displays nonideal micellization behavior. It is shown that the bulk component of the Gibbs energy of micelle formation deends linearly on the micelle compn. and hence does not account for any nonideal behavior displayed by the mixed micelles. In contrast, the interfacial component has a nonlinear dependence on the compn. of the mixed micelle and thus constitutes the source of the obsd. nonidealities in mixed micellar systems. Therefore, surfactant mixts. displaying markedly nonideal micellization behavior are those for which the interfacial interactions show significant compn. dependence. Illustrative results based on this mol. theory are obtained for a no. of binary mixts. and are compared against the available exptl. data.},

The presence of urea in the solvation region of the apolar sphere is found to weaken the water-water interactions in this region, although they are still stronger than in the bulk solvent. Urea-water interactions are enhanced in the solvation region as compared to aqueous urea. The implications of the results for the experimentally known improved solvation of apolar molecules in aqueous urea are discussed. The phenomenon appears likely to be dominated by the fact that each urea molecule displaces several water molecules from the apolar solvation shell.},

With increasing the concen-tration of 1,3-butanediol in the mixed solvent at room temperature, the biphasic solution converts into turbid phase, two phase, and finally to a clear phase that is bire-fringent when viewed between two crossed polarizers. The birefringent phase moves to lower 1,3-butanediol contents at higher temperature values. The birefringent phase was ob-served via polarizing microscopy, and its rheological param-eters were measured with cone plate method. In high 1,3-butanediol contents, solutions with 2.5{\%} of PC behave as a gel with high yield stress value. The micellization of cetyl-trimethyammonium bromide (CTAB) in a series of 1,3-butanediol/water mixed solvent at room temperature was also investigated. From the conductivity measurements, the critical micelle concentration and the degree of counterion dissociation of CTAB were obtained as a function of 1,3-butanediol. Standard free energy of micellization, as a func-tion of 1,3-butanediol contents, was also estimated and discussed.

The experimental data is analyzed by formulating a ``slithering snake'' mechanism and simulating it on a cubic lattice, using a coarse-grained Monte Carlo framework. The influence of shear rate, precursor concentration, and length of Kuhn segment on the morphology of the nanorods are examined. Experiments indicate that the shear is necessary for the formation of nanorods, although diameter and length of the nanorods are insensitive to the shear rate, within the range of shear rates investigated. The model adequately captures the features of directional aggregation of particles, and the computed length and diameter correspond to the typical dimensions of the nanorods obtained experimentally. The protocol has considerable potential for producing nanorods of several materials simply by changing the precursors.},

The purpose of the present work was to investigate the spectroscopic response in the range 1100-2400 nm of solutions of glucose, fructose, and sucrose at concentrations 5-65{\%}. Data indicate that by increasing sugar concentration the water band becomes more symmetric and there is a shift of the absorption maximum toward longer wavelengths. Spectra were interpreted in terms of "structure- maker" and "structure-breaker" effects of increasing sugar concentration. Sugars at low concentrations behave as structure breaker of the water cluster, while at higher concentrations they act as structure makers. These results could be of some interest when monitoring by NIR processes as freezing, freeze-drying, drying, cryoconcentration, etc. of fruits and vegetables, where the removal or separation of large amounts of water induce the formation of very concentrated sugars solutions. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The head movement of a walking pigeon Columba livia is characterized by two alternating phases, a thrust phase and a hold phase. While the head is rapidly thrust forward during the thrust phase, it has been shown repeatedly that it remains virtually motionless with respect to translation along a horizontal axis (roll axis) during the hold phase. It has been shown that the stabilization during the hold phase is under visual control. This has led to the view that the pigeon's head-bobbing is an optokinetic response to stabilize the retinal image during the hold phase. However, it has never been shown explicitly that the head is really held stable in space with respect to other translatory or rotatory dimensions. Using videography, we show here that this is in fact the case: except for a small but systematic slip that presumably serves as an error signal for retinal image stabilization, the head of the pigeon remains locked in space not only with respect to the horizontal (roll) axis but also with respect to vertical translation (along the yaw axis) and with respect to rotation around the pitch and yaw axes.},

abstract = {The effect of an organic counterion, p-toluenesulfonate (p-TS−) and a Hofmeister series of inorganic counterions, NO3−, Br−and SO42–on the solvation dynamics and rotational relaxation of Coumarin 480 (C-480) in the Stern layer of aqueous micelles of hexadecyltrimethylammonium surfactants (C16TAX) has been studied. Studies have been carried out by means of UV–vis absorption, steady-state fluorescence and fluorescence anisotropy, time-resolved fluorescence and fluorescence anisotropy, and dynamic light scattering measurements. The rate of solvation increases in the order C16TABr {\textless} C16TANO3 {\textless} (C16TA)2SO4 {\textless} C16TAp-TS. Effectively, the solvation process is controlled by the extent of release of water molecules during the formation of micelles which depends on the nature of counterion. p-TS−counterions are more tightly bound to the headgroups because of added effect of its hydrophobic part. Counterions indirectly contribute to the slow solvation by the formation of clusters of water molecules. The decreasing order of the average rotational relaxation time of C-480 in the micelles of surfactants is C16TAp-TS {\textgreater}{\textgreater} C16TABr {\textgreater} C16TANO3 {\textgreater} (C16TA)2SO4, which is the same as the decreasing order of microviscosity of micelles. The rotational relaxation time is shorter in the micelles of (C16TA)2SO4as compared to C16TAp-TS as the former micelles have less tightly packed structure than the latter. The slow rotational relaxation is mainly contributed by the lateral diffusion of C-480 along the surface of the micelle. The rotational motion is the slowest for the micelle of (C16TA)2SO4, and the same is the fastest for the micelle of C16TABr. There is an indication of different orientation of C-480 molecules in viscous micelles of C16TAp-TS as compared to other less viscous micelles. The fact of counterion dependent solvation processes might help us for various studies on physicochemical properties of surfactants in solutions.},

The aqueous CTAB/NapTS solutions were classified into five different categories dependent on their flow behavior and micellar structure. By increasing salt concentration and/or shear rates, the micelles underwent morphological transition from (i) spherical or short rodlike micelles to (ii) long rodlike micelles without entanglements, followed by (iii) those with entanglements. These transitions were recognized as changes in flow behavior from Newtonian to shear-thickening and shear-thinning flow, respectively. In the latter two cases, anisotropic SANS patterns appeared around these critical shear rates. The physical meaning of the anisotropic SANS patterns accompanied by shear-thickening flow behavior is discussed in conjunction with other shear-thickening systems.},

Increasing amounts at the surface of the penetrating counterion of the pair, 2,6-dichlorobenzoate, lowers the 1D bending modulus of the micelles, making them more flexible. Micellar contour lengths exhibit a maximum with increasing amounts of a,2,6-dichlorobenzoate at the micellar surface. This is understood in terms of decreases in the micellar end-cap energies, E-c, at high concentrations of penetrating counterion. By decreasing the effective micellar surface charge density, penetrating counterions also cause decreased contributions from electrostatic repulsion, E-e, which retard micellar growth. At low ionic strengths, this results in more extensive micellar growth upon addition of sodium 2,6-dichlorobenzoate rather than NaCl.},

abstract = {We present a systematic study of thermodynamics, structure, and rheology of mixtures of cationic wormlike micelles and like-charged nanoparticles. Structural and thermodynamic measurements in dilute surfactant-nanoparticle mixtures show the formation of micelle-nanoparticle junctions that act as physical cross-links between micelles. The presence of these junctions is shown to build significant viscosity and viscoelasticity in dilute and semidilute WLMs, even in cases where the fluid is Newtonian in the absence of nanoparticles. Increases in viscosity, shear modulus, and relaxation time, as well as decreases in entanglement concentration, are observed with increasing particle concentration. As such, nanoparticle addition gives rise to a so-called "double network" comprised of micellar entanglements and particle junctions. A simple model for such networks is proposed, where the elasticity can be tuned through two energetic scales, the micellar end-cap energy and micelle-nanoparticle adsorption energy. As a practical application, the results demonstrate that nanoparticle addition provides formulators a unique method to tailor surfactant solution rheology over a wide range of conditions.},

abstract = {We report an investigation of the structural properties of dilauroyl-phosphatidyl-uridine wormlike micelles by the combined use of static light scattering and small angle neutron scattering techniques. The q-range covered in the reciprocal space is large enough for a complete structural characterization of micellar aggregates, which can be deduced in terms of contour length, persistence length, and cross sectional radius. In particular, the structural parameters have been extracted through a nonlinear least-squares fitting of the experimental spectra by parametrized wormlike chain scattering functions, obtained with Monte Carlo methods.(1,2) This procedure includes excluded volume interactions, micellar polidispersity, and intermicellar effects. The main result is an accurate estimate of micellar flexibility in terms of persistence length (230 Angstrom). We also show that the persistence length for nucleoside derivative surfactants is not a simple function of the surfactant tail length. A modest change in the hindrance and in the chemical nature of the surfactant polar head, as the exchange of uridine with adenine, produces a significant change in the stiffness of the wormlike micelles. The results are compared to most wormlike systems currently investigated and the biologically relevant implications due to the nucleosidic nature of the phospholipid derivative polar head are discussed.},

abstract = {Diffusing wave spectroscopy (DWS) can be employed as an optical rheology tool with numerous applications for studying the structure, dynamics and linear viscoelastic properties of complex fluids, foams, glasses and gels. To carry out DWS measurements, one first needs to quantify the static optical properties of the sample under investigation, i.e. the transport mean free path {\$}l{\^{}}\backslashast{\$} and the absorption length {\$}l{\_}a{\$}. In the absence of absorption this can be done by comparing the diffuse optical transmission to a calibration sample whose {\$}l{\^{}}\backslashast{\$} is known. Performing this comparison however is cumbersome, time consuming and prone to mistakes by the operator. Moreover, already weak absorption can lead to significant errors. In this paper, we demonstrate the implementation of an automatized approach, based on which the DWS measurement procedure can be simplified significantly. By comparison with a comprehensive set of calibration measurements we cover the entire parameter space relating measured count rates (CR{\$}{\_}t{\$}, CR{\$}{\_}b{\$}) to ({\$}l{\^{}}\backslashast{\$}, {\$}l{\_}a{\$}). Based on this approach we can determine {\$}l{\^{}}\backslashast{\$} and {\$}l{\_}a{\$} of an unknown sample accurately thus making the additional measurement of a calibration sample obsolete. We illustrate the use of this approach by monitoring the coarsening of a commercially available shaving foam with DWS.},

abstract = {The contrast variation technique by adding sucrose to aqueous solvents as an electron density adjusting reagent was applied to small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) from a dual surfactant wormlike micelle consisting of sodium lauryl ether sulfate and coconut fatty acid amido propyl betaine in order to evaluate the flexibility and the cross-sectional structure of the micelle. The salt concentration dependence of the zero-shear and dynamic viscosities were found not to be affected by the cation species nor the presence of sucrose in the solution. SAXS showed that the scattering profile [I(q)] can be fitted a double layer cylinder model. By systematically changing the sucrose concentration (CS), a "matching composition" was found in which the shell layer can become invisible in SAXS for each sodium cation concentration ([Na+]). From this composition, the electron densities of the shell (rhoS) and core (rhoC) layers were evaluated to be 370 and 216 e/nm(-3), respectively. These values were consistent with the chemical structure of the surfactant. At these matching compositions, I(q) was measured at low q range (0.03 nm(-1){\textless}q{\textless}4 nm(-1)) and the data points were perfectly fitted with a single layer rigid cylinder model, except for [Na+]{\textgreater}1.02 M. In these larger [Na+], the I(q) showed an up-turn deviation from the rigid rod limit (i.e., I(q) proportional, variant q(-1)) at low q, indicating appearance of the flexibility of the cylinder. By applying a wormlike cylinder theory, the Kuhn statistical segment length was evaluated as a function of [Na+]. At the infinite limit of [Na+], the intrinsic Kuhn length (excluding of the electrostatic interactions) can be evaluated to be about 20-40 nm. This value was comparable with that of the wormlike micelles made of nonionic surfactants.},

Both surfactants self-assemble into lamellar liquid crystalline, either L $\alpha$ (fluid) and L $\beta$ (gel), phases. The gel-to-fluid phase transition temperature (T m) in DDAB lamellae was found to be higher than that observed for its vesicles, due to the formation of a stabilized gel phase. In addition, the lamellar phases formed by both amphiphiles differ in their swelling degree and bilayer thickness. DODAB in water formed rather thin bilayers, if compared with the length of the tails, suggesting effective chain interdigitation. These bilayers also presented higher swelling degree than those formed by the shorter-chain homologue DDAB. We propose that these structural properties are strongly influenced by the electrostatic repulsive forces acting on the system.},

abstract = {The Diffusive Interfacial Transport (DIT) method for performing phase studies (in which all the phases that exist along an isotherm are produced by isothermal swelling and their compositions determined by using refractive index data) was introduced in 1987.(1) While this method represented a significant qualitative advance in phase studies methodology, its quantitative accuracy has since been found to be unsatisfactory. We describe herein the DIT-NIR method in which execution of the study is the same as before, but peak-area data on the bend-stretch combination band of water are used to determine composition. Peak-area data are obtained by using Fourier transform near-infrared (FT-NIR) microspectroscopy. Calibration studies with octyldimethylphosphine oxide-water mixtures demonstrated that peak areas vary linearly with composition over the entire composition range. The slopes of calibration lines follow a power-law dependence upon temperature. Phase studies of the C12E3-water system, using both DIT-NIR and isoplethal methods, validate the applicability of the DIT-NIR method to systems other than phosphine oxides. These data suggest that DIT-NIR may represent a new general method for the complete and accurate quantitative determination of binary aqueous surfactant phase diagrams. Further, the spectroscopic data can provide new information on the physical state of the material under study.},

Simultaneous, time-resolved small-angle and wide-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS and WAXS) on heating and cooling are used to study the formation of the microphase-separated lamellar structure and the crystallization of the ethylene blocks, respectively. Sharp first- and higher-order SAXS peaks (as many as four reflections) evolve rapidly and simultaneously on cooling from the homogeneous melt, characteristic of a highly-ordered domain structure with relatively sharp interfaces. These semicrystalline diblocks thus form microdomains which appear strongly segregated, even though the small undercoolings used would put amorphous block copolymers in the weak segregation regime. Crystallization of the E blocks exactly tracks the development of the microdomain structure. During the initial rapid structure development, the SAXS peak positions are constant, suggesting that the ordered structures nucleate and simply grow to fill the sample, without any accompanying internal rearrangement. At longer times, a small decrease of the microdomain spacing is observed, attributed to the relaxation of a structure initially out of equilibrium.},

abstract = {Responsive wormlike micelles are very useful in a number of applications, whereas it is still challenging to create dramatic viscosity changes in wormlike micellar systems. Here we developed a pH-responsive wormlike micelles based on noncovalent constructed surfactant, which is formed by complexation of N-erucamidopropyl-N,N-dimethylamine (UC22AMPM) and citric acid at the molar ratio of 3:1 (EACA). The phase behavior, aggregate microstructure and viscoealsticity of EACA solutions were investigated by macroscopic appearance observation, rheological and Cryo-TEM measurements. It was found that the phase behavior of EACA solutions undergoes transitions from transparent viscoelastic fluid to opalescent solution and then phase separation with white floater upon increasing pH. With increasing pH from 2.03 to 6.17, the viscosity of wormlike micelles in the transparent solutions continously increased and reached to {\~{}}683,000 mPa•s at pH 6.17. As pH was adjusted to 7.13, the opalescent solution shows a water-like flowing behaviour and the $\eta$0 rapid declines to {\~{}}1 mPa•s. Thus, dramatic viscosity changes of about 6 magnitutes can be triggered by varying pH without any deterioration for EACA system. This drastic variation in rheological behavior is attributed to the pH dependent interaction between UC22AMPM and citric acid. Furthermore, concentration and temperature dependence of the rheological behavior for EACA solutions were also studied to benefit for obtaining a desired pH-responsive viscosity changes.},

This phenomenon, often termed as the Toms Effect, is highly dependent not only on molecular weight (MW) but also on the flexibility of the macromolecular chain. This paper describes the effects of poly(ethylene oxide) MW, concentration, and chain compaction on the impact structures produced during collision between a droplet against a shallow liquid surface (splash), both liquids containing the polymer. The impact energy stored in the splash structures (composed of crown, cavity, and Rayleigh jet) was estimated using a simple model and some morphological parameters obtained from instantaneous images of the splash. It was observed that the height of the Rayleigh jet, a liquid column produced from the collapse of the crown and the cavity, is highly sensitive to the elongational viscosity of the solution.},

abstract = {We considered the mutual influence of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) and methanol, ethanol as well as 1-propanol on their behaviour in the aqueous solution. This consideration was based on the surface tension, density, viscosity and conductivity measurements of the aqueous solutions of CTAB and alcohol mixture at 293. K in the whole range of alcohol concentration and in the presence of the surfactant in the monomeric and aggregated forms in the solution. Additionally, the dynamic light scattering measurements were made at the surfactant and alcohol concentration at which the aggregation of their molecules can be expected. CTAB practically does not influence the possibility of the formation of the small aggregates of alcohols and slightly affects the partial and apparent molar volumes of water and alcohols, but alcohols considerably affect the critical micelle concentration (CMC) of CTAB and the degree of counterions bound to its micelles. The mixed micelles of CTAB and methanol are probably formed in the whole range of alcohol concentration but those of CTAB and ethanol or 1-propanol only in their concentration range in which they are present in the monomeric form in the solution. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V..},

Variation in pH alters the charge on the polar group and leads to protonation/deprotonation of acidic/basic group of the additives. Depending upon the pH of solution additives interact with CTAB micelles and accordingly change the solution behavior/aggregation characteristics. Morphological changes of surfactant aggregates as a function of additive concentration and pH were monitored by SANS measurements.

abstract = {Solutions of worm-like micelles display a rich rheological behavior that makes them useful as, for example, drag-reducing agents or viscosity enhancers. The properties of these solutions depend on the morphology and interactions between the micelles, both of which can be tuned by changing solution conditions. Although there has been extensive theoretical study of these solutions, there are often conflicting explanations, or no explanation, of an observed trend. Application of cryogenic transmission electron microscopy (cryo-TEM) for the direct visualization of the micelles can help correlate microstructure to rheology. Of particular interest is the cause of a maximum in viscosity as a function of increasing surfactant or salt concentration. Several studies support the theory of a transition from linear to branched micelles, while other studies report no change in microstructure or no connection between structure evolution and changes in viscosity. More systematic and thorough studies that combine cryo-TEM with other experimental techniques are needed. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The pH-dependent phase behavior and hydroxide-ion adsorption ability of a series of (reduced) carbohydrate-based gemini surfactants were studied between pH 2 and 12. Static and dynamic light scattering were employed to address transitions in the aggregate morphologies and cryo-electron microscopy was used to provide further evidence for the morphologies present in solution. Changes in aggregate structure as a result of a change in solution pH and an accompanying change in protonation state or a change in molecular structure can be rationalized in terms of the variations in the packing parameter. In this paper we have focused our attention on the size of the carbohydrate moiety, the carbohydrate stereochemistry and the nature of the spacer (hydrophobic vs hydrophilic). At near neutral pH, most of the gemini surfactants form vesicles. Upon lowering of the pH, the vesicles undergo a transition toward wormlike micelles followed by a transition to spherical micelles. Upon increasing the solution pH, flocculation occurs due to charge neutralization followed at still higher pH by redispersion and charge reversal of the vesicles through the specific adsorption of hydroxide ions to the vesicular surface. Upon decreasing head group size at constant, but low, degrees of protonation, the packing parameter has a tendency to become larger than one resulting in the formation of inverted phases. Upon further decrease in the head group size, oil droplets are observed. In case of a hydrophobic spacer, the carbohydrate stereochemistry affects the pH of the transitions, but not the type of the transitions. By contrast, for a hydrophilic spacer, the pH of the transitions remains unaffected. Adsorption of hydroxide ions at basic pH follows similar trends, but was only found for vesicles and oil droplets. The large range of structural variations that we have examined allows a better understanding of the requirements for the phase transitions for carbohydrate-based gemini surfactants as well as for the physisorption of hydroxide ions to interfaces in general.},

The understanding of why certain products are more stable than others at the same aw needs an elucidation of water structure. Of particular importance are the interactions (hydrophilic, hydrophobic) between water and the components of the foodstuff and the effect of the soluble molecules of the food on the hydrogen bonding in solvent water. Studying water in foods should start with an anlytical determination of water content for commercial and legal reasons which are evident. This has to be completed with the measurement of the thermodynamic activity of water in the food. Such a parameter (aw) should hold an important place in the identification of the food product, especially as regards its shelf life. A further step in unveiling the behaviour of water in foods consists in determining water molecules in the molecules in the studied food matrix. The tripartite (analytical, thermodynamical and structural) approach to water in foods will be examined based on examples of sugars and sugar rich products.},

abstract = {Aqueous mixtures of egg-yolk lecithin and the bile salt glycochenodeoxycholic acid sodium salt are studied using small-angle neutron scattering. Upon dilution, the shape and size of the aggregates change dramatically. This is due to very different critical micellar concentrations and spontaneous curvatures of lecithin and bile salt. At high concentrations, cylindrical micelles with a length of a few hundred angstroms are formed. As the samples are diluted, the length of the micelles first decreases and then increases by a factor of 3, their flexibility becomes noticeable, and the micelles can be described as semiflexible cylindrical micelles, also known as wormlike micelles. We have developed a mathematical model for the scattering of the wormlike micelles, which takes into account the intermicellar interaction effects. By the simultaneous fitting of the scattering data from a range of concentrations, the concentration-dependent growth law of the micelles can be parametrized. The obtained growth law of the mixed micelles is compared to the growth laws observed in simple micellar systems.},

abstract = {Dielectric constant data have been obtained at several temperatures for aqueous solutions of acetone, aniline, ethyl ether, glycerol, glycine, and urea. Density determinations have been made at 25° for the solutions containing acetone, aniline, glycine, and urea. These data and the Debye theory of the salting-out effect make possible calculations of the limiting slopes of the solubility curves for the non-electrolyte solutes as a function of salt concentration. In this report attention has been confined largely to systems containing aniline and ethyl ether. The dielectric constant measurements are found to lead to calculated solubilities in good agreement with those actually observed in the more dilute salt solutions and when larger differences appear they seem to be due in considerable measure to the fact that the solubility measurements have been made in a salt concentration range too high for the limiting law of the theory. The data are most successful in that they contribute to the establishment of the essential correctness of the Debye theory which describes the primary salting-out in terms of the relative electrical susceptibility of the non-electrolyte components and the electrical fields of force in the neighborhood of the ions.},

abstract = {The nature of various molecular interactions occurring in the sucrose-water system and the structure of the aqueous solution are outlined briefly. The thermodynamic implications of these interactions are discussed, with special emphasis placed on the sucrose hydration number and the water activity coefficient. The existing "chemical" models of water activity, due to Scatchard (1921), Stokes and Robinson (1966), Sch{\"{o}}nert (1986), and Van Hook (1987), are evaluated in detail, including their predictive ability for dilute solutions and their limiting behavior in the region of high sucrose content. Some suggestions, based on the sucrose association mechanism, are made with regard to possible reformulations of the existing activity models that could result in a powerful thermodynamic model of the system.},

abstract = {Slow-motion imaging of the rupture of soap bubbles generally shows the edges of liquid films retracting at a constant speed (known as the Taylor-Culick velocity). Here we investigate soap bubbles formed from simple solutions of a cationic surfactant (cetyltrimethylammonium bromide - CTAB) and sodium salicylate. The interaction of salicylate ions with CTAB leads to the formation of wormlike micelles (WLM), which yield a viscoelastic behavior to the liquid film of the bubble. We demonstrate that these elastic bubbles collapse at a velocity up to 30 times higher than the Taylor-Culick limit, which has never been surpassed. This is because during the bubble inflation, the entangled WLM chains stretch, storing elastic energy. This extra energy is then released during the rupture of the bubble, yielding an additional driving force for film retraction (besides surface tension). This new mechanism for the bursting of elastic bubbles may have important implications to the breakup of viscoelastic sprays in industrial applications.},

In combination with a three-pronged b-cyclodextrin core, supramolecular self-assembly was exploited for the formation of star-shaped architectures. This was demonstrated via a combination of dynamic light scattering (DLS) and 2D rotating frame nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy (ROESY) in D 2 O. Furthermore, turbidity measurements in the case of PDEAAm showed a rise in the LCST of the system. The complex formation was shown to be reversible, as DLS at elevated temperatures (70 C) indicated a complete disassembly of the star polymers.},

All these systems demonstrated viscoelastic behavior at room temperature and showed effective drag reduction in the temperature range of 20–70 °C. The additional Cl- or CH3- group on the salicylate extended the upper effective drag reduction temperature limit 5–10 °C higher than that of sodium salicylate solution. The 4-methylsalicylate, and 3- and 5-chlorosalicylate solutions are effective drag reducers down to 5 °C, the lowest temperature tested in the flow loop. All of the methyl isomers had very similar rheological behaviors, while the chloro isomers exhibited dramatic differences. The 5-chlorosalicylate system had near zero N1, but did show viscoelastic behavior by showing recoil after swirling and overshoot at shear startup. Cryo-TEM images show that four of the isomer systems formed threadlike micellar nanostructures, but 3-methylsalicylate aggregated into vesicles and open vesicles. The 3-chloro and 5-chlorosalicylate showed vesicles with a few spherical micelles and threadlike micelles. It is postulated that the vesicles were transformed into threadlike micelles under shear and that this structure made them effective drag reducers.},

The effects of the surfactant concentration, added salt, temperature and different counterions on the viscoelastic solutions have been systematically investigated. In a salt-free state, the eta(0) and R(16)HTAB concentrations obey the relationship of the power law, i.e. eta(0) proportional to C-2.53, in the examined concentration range. The addition of NaSal greatly promoted the micellar growth in R(16)HTAB aqueous solution and resulted in the generation of wormlike micelles.

The zero-shear viscosity $\eta$0as well as the longest relaxation time TRrevealed a monotonic decrease upon increasing the concentration of cosurfactant with shorter chain length. The plateau modulus G0decreases for all mixtures except for the C16TAB-C14TAB mixture where it increases slightly.

The surface-tension vs log [DTAB] plot for solutions containing DTAB/trianion = 15:1 showed an abrupt break (routinely taken as the critical micelle concentration, CMC) at 2.9 mM. This constitutes a 5-fold decrease compared with a CMC of 15 mM for pure aqueous DTAB. There is a 10-fold decrease in the break-point concentration caused by a mere 3 mol {\%} of hexanion. Corresponding CMC values from DTAB/trianion mixtures, measured by both conductivity and diffusion NMR, gave normal values of 14 mM. The unusual discrepancy between the CMC based on surface tension and on the two "bulk" methods was attributed to saturation of the air/water interface by a DTAB/trianion complex far below the concentration at which the micelles form.

abstract = {The effect of different ionic cosolutes (NaCl, Na(2)SO(4), Li(2)SO(4), NaSCN, Na(2)[Fe(CN)(5)NO], and Na(3)[Co(NO)(6)]) on the interaction between sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) was examined by small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and isothermal titration calorimetric techniques. The critical aggregation concentration values (cac), the saturation concentration (C(2)), the integral enthalpy change for aggregate formation ($\Delta$H(agg)(int)) and the standard free energy change of micelle adsorption on the macromolecule chain ($\Delta$$\Delta$G(agg)) were derived from the calorimetric titration curves. In the presence of 1.00 mmol L(-1) cosolute, no changes in the parameters were observed when compared with those obtained for SDS-PEO interactions in pure water. For NaCl, Na(2)SO(4), Li(2)SO(4), and NaSCN at 10.0 and 100 mmol L(-1), the cosolute presence lowered cac, increased C(2), and the PEO-SDS aggregate became more stable. In the presence of Na(2)[Fe(CN)(5)NO], the calorimetric titration curves changed drastically, showing a possible reduction in the PEO-SDS degree of interaction, possibility disrupting the formed nanostructure; however, the SAXS data confirmed, independent of the small energy observed, the presence of aggregates adsorbed on the polymer chain.},

Water, D-ribose, or tetraglycerol were used as the polar substance and were key ingredients for forming the reverse worms. Using the reverse worms, 1 wt{\%} of testosterone could be stably solubilized. When using D-ribose as polar substance, the maximum zero-shear viscosity of the reverse worms solution was higher than that of systems using water or tetraglycerol as the polar substance. The mechanism of skin permeation of testosterone from reverse worms solution was elucidated using skin permeation experiments with hairless mouse skin. When the structure of the reverse worms transitioned to lamellar liquid crystals at the skin/formulation interface, testosterone became supersaturated in the formulations. The structural transition occurred in systems using water or D-ribose as the polar substance, increasing the flux of testosterone. The flux of testosterone from reverse worms solution thus depends on the type of polar substance used.},

In the cationic and the nonionic micelles, significantly higher fluorescence quantum yield is observed in comparison to the anionic micelles, due to much lower accessibility of DMO to the water molecules in the former micelles than the latter. Time-resolved fluorescence decays were characterized by a fast ($\tau$1) and a slow ($\tau$2) component of decay in all the micelles. The fast decay component ($\tau$1) increases significantly in going from the anionic micelles to the cationic micelles, because of the poorly hydrated headgroup region of the latter micelles compared to the former. Furthermore, much higher value of the slow component of decay ($\tau$2) is observed for the cationic and the neutral micelles than the anionic micelles. This is attributed to the increased penetration of water molecules into the micellar core of the anionic micelles compared to the cationic and the neutral micelles.},

abstract = {Aqueous mixtures of egg-yolk lecithin and the bile salt glycochenodeoxycholic acid sodium salt are studied using small-angle neutron scattering. Upon dilution, the shape and size of the aggregates change dramatically. This is due to very different critical micellar concentrations and spontaneous curvatures of lecithin and bile salt. At high concentrations, cylindrical micelles with a length of a few hundred angstroms are formed. As the samples are diluted, the length of the micelles first decreases and then increases by a factor of 3, their flexibility becomes noticeable, and the micelles can be described as semiflexible cylindrical micelles, also known as wormlike micelles. We have developed a mathematical model for the scattering of the wormlike micelles, which takes into account the intermicellar interaction effects. By the simultaneous fitting of the scattering data from a range of concentrations, the concentration-dependent growth law of the micelles can be parametrized. The obtained growth law of the mixed micelles is compared to the growth laws observed in simple micellar systems.},

@article{Castillo-Tejas2011,
abstract = {In this work, the rheology of complex fluids, i.e., surfactants of varying concentration in a Lennard-Jones fluid, is analyzed with non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations. The molecular model considers that the surfactant molecule is composed of a hydrophilic head, affine to solvent, and a hydrophobic tail made of four monomers. The solvent is modeled by a Lennard-Jones fluid, which shows mostly a Newtonian behavior, but at relatively high shear rates, a slight shear-thinning followed by a slight shear thickening are exhibited. The intermolecular potential produces an equilibrium configuration, in which the surfactant molecules self-assemble in a wormlike micelle. With the aim to analyze the system behavior with various stress fields, two flows are simulated under non-equilibrium conditions: (1) simple shear and (2) Poiseuille's flow. In simple shear, by keeping the velocity of the upper plate of the flow cell constant, a monotonic flow curve is predicted within a range of shear rates. At low shear rates, a concentration-dependent Newtonian region of viscosity $\eta$0corresponds to an isotropic condition in which the wormlike micelle preserves its equilibrium conformation. At intermediate shear rates, the solution exhibits a slight shear thinning, generating bands placed normal to the gradient direction (gradient banding). At high shear rates the solution exhibits shear-thickening, with bands now generated normal to the vorticity direction. These predictions by molecular models explain, to our knowledge for the first time, experiments in shear-thickening wormlike micellar solutions, where shear-thickening appears simultaneously with bands generated perpendicular to the vorticity axis. In Poiseuille's flow, we also find agreement between predictions of the model with theoretical developments and experiments performed by other authors. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The pharmacological action of chloroquine relies on its ability to cross biological membranes in order to accumulate inside lysosomes. The present work aimed at understanding the basis for the interaction between different chloroquine species and ionic micelles of opposite charges, the latter used as a simple membrane model. The sensitivity of absorbance and fluorescence of chloroquine to changes in its local environment was used to probe its interaction with cetyltrimethylammonium micelles presenting bromide (CTAB) and sulfate (CTAS) as counterions, in addition to dodecyl sulfate micelles bearing sodium (SDS) and tetramethylammonium (TMADS) counterions. Counterion exchange was shown to have little effect on drug-micelle interaction. Chloroquine first dissociation constant (pKa1) shifted to opposite directions when anionic and cationic micelles were compared. Chloroquine binding constants (Kb) revealed that electrostatic forces mediate charged drug-micelle association, whereas hydrophobic interactions allowed neutral chloroquine to associate with anionic and cationic micelles. Fluorescence quenching studies indicated that monoprotonated chloroquine is inserted deeper into the micelle surface of anionic micelles than its neutral form, the latter being less exposed to the aqueous phase when associated with cationic over anionic assemblies. The findings provide further evidence that chloroquine-micelle interaction is driven by a tight interplay between the drug form and the micellar surface charge, which can have a major effect on the drug biological activity. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Complexes of oppositely charged polymers and surfactants (OCPS) in water come in many varieties, including liquid-crystalline materials, soluble complexes, structured nanoparticles, and water-insoluble surface layers. The range of available structures and properties increases even further with the addition of other amphiphilic substances that may enter, or even dissolve, the complexes, depending on the nature of the additive. Simple operations may change the properties of OCPS systems dramatically. For instance, dilution with water can induce a phase separation in an initially stable OCPS solution. More complicated processes, involving chemical reactions, can be used to either create or disintegrate OCPS particles or surface layers. The richness of their properties has made OCPS mixtures ubiquitous in everyday household products, such as shampoos and laundry detergents, and also attractive ingredients in the design of new types of responsive particles, surfaces, and delivery agents of potential use in future applications. A challenge for the rational design of an OCPS system is, however, to obtain a good fundamental understanding of how to select molecular shapes and sizes and how to tune the hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions such that the desired properties are obtained. Recent studies of OCPS phase equilibria, using a strategy where the minimum number of components is always used to address a particular question, have brought out general rules and trends that can be used for such a rational design. Those fundamental studies are reviewed here, together with more application-oriented studies where fundamental learning has been put to use.},

abstract = {The self-assembly into wormlike micelles of a poly(ethylene oxide)-b-poly(propylene oxide)-b-poly(ethylene oxide) triblock copolymer Pluronic P84 in aqueous salt solution (2 M NaCl) has been studied by rheology, small-angle X-ray and neutron scattering (SAXS/SANS), and light scattering. Measurements of the flow curves by controlled stress rheometry indicated phase separation under flow. SAXS on solutions subjected to capillary flow showed alignment of micelles at intermediate shear rates, although loss of alignment was observed for high shear rates. For dilute solutions, SAXS and static light scattering data on unaligned samples could be superposed over three decades in scattering vector, providing unique information on the wormlike micelle structure over several length scales. SANS data provided information on even shorter length scales, in particular, concerning "blob" scattering from the micelle corona. The data could be modeled based on a system of semiflexible self-avoiding cylinders with a circular cross-section, as described by the wormlike chain model with excluded volume interactions. The micelle structure was compared at two temperatures close to the cloud point (47 degrees C). The micellar radius was found not to vary with temperature in this region, although the contour length increased with increasing temperature, whereas the Kuhn length decreased. These variations result in an increase of the low-concentration radius of gyration with increasing temperature. This was consistent with dynamic light scattering results, and, applying theoretical results from the literature, this is in agreement with an increase in endcap energy due to changes in hydration of the poly(ethylene oxide) blocks as the temperature is increased.},

abstract = {Self-assembly in soft-matter systems often results in the formation of locally cylindrical or chain-like structures. We review the theory of these systems whose large-scale structure and properties depend on whether the chains are finite, with end-caps or join to form junctions that result in networks. Physical examples discussed here include physical gels, wormlike micelles, dipolar fluids and microemulsions. In all these cases, the competition between end-caps and junctions results in an entropic phase separation into junction-rich and junction-poor phases, as recently observed by electron microscopy and seen in computer simulations. A simple model that accounts for these phenomena is reviewed. Extensions of these ideas can be applied to treat network formation and phase separation in a system of telechelic (hydrophobically tipped, hydrophilic) polymers and oil-in-water microemulsions, as observed in recent experiments.},

@article{Cho2017,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 IOP Publishing Ltd. We present a comprehensive introduction to the photorheological (PR) fluids whose rheological behavior can be changed by ultraviolet (UV) light with a wavelength of 365 nm. When the PR fluid was exposed to UV light, the viscosity of the fluid decreased, while the viscosity recovered to its initial value when UV light was turned off, indicating that the viscosity of these types of fluids can be reversible and tunable by UV light. Contrary to conventional smart fluids, such as electrorheological and magnetorheological fluids, PR fluid does not suffer from a phase splitting problem because it exists in a single-phase solution. Additionally, the PR fluid does not require any contact component, such as electrodes, and electric wires that are essential components for conventional smart fluids. In this work, the PR fluids were synthesized by doping lecithin/sodium deoxycholate reverse micelles with a photo-chromic spiropyran compound. It is demonstrated that the viscosity changes of PR fluids can be induced by UV light, and their rheological properties are examined in detail. In addition, an example of tailoring rheological properties using photoluminescence was introduced for improved response time. One of the potential applications, such as microfluidic flow control using the PR fluids, is also briefly presented.},

Our findings indicated that in the temperature range measured, the solubility of sucralose in D2O is 23.3{\%} lower than in H2O. Based on such measurements, the dissolution Gibbs free energy, enthalpy and entropy were then determined. The values of solubility and the mentioned thermodynamic parameters were compared to the ones for sucralose in H2O. Beside the determination of dissolution enthalpy by using the van't Hoff Equation, this thermodynamic property was also measured for the two solvents in an isoperibol solution-reaction calorimeter.},

There is a good agreement between micelle ionization degrees computed from zeta potential measurements and those from ion- selective electrodes experiments. This demonstrates that electrophoresis experiments may be replaced by the simpler ion-selective electrode measurements to determine micelle surface potential. It has also been concluded that ion-selective elec- trodes detect only the non-micellised ions, that only free ions contribute to the intermicellar solution ionic strength, and micelles do not affect the result, and that the dependence of the electrophoretic mobility on the soap concentration is due to the reduction of the micelle net charge when the ionic strength of the intermicellar solution arises.},

Modern ITC instruments make it possible to measure heat rates as small as 0.1$\mu$cal/sec, allowing for the precise determination of reaction rates in the range of 10-12mol/sec. Values for Kmand kcat, in the ranges of 10-2-103$\mu$M and 0.05-500sec-1, respectively, can be determined by ITC.

abstract = {The influence of simple structural modification on the solubility of a series of poorly soluble benzodiazepines in sodium salicylate solution was investigated. Results of solubility and spectral studies indicate that an electrostatic force of the donor-acceptor type plays an important role in the solubilization of these compounds by hydrotropy. In an attempt to explain the characteristic positive deviation in hydrotropic solubilization diagrams, the solution properties of sodium salicylate were studied. Conductivity experiments indicate molecular aggregation of sodium salicylate at a concentration of 0.67 M at 25°C. The aggregation concentration increases as a function of temperature. Results obtained from density, viscosity and diffusion studies are consistent with those of conductivity measurements. The remarkable increase in the solubilizing effect of sodium salicylate is probably associated with aggregate formation. Inclusion of the benzodiazepine molecules in the sodium salicylate aggregates is thought to be the mechanism responsible for the solubilization of these drugs. A donor-acceptor interaction between sodium salicylate and benzodiazepine molecules is assumed to stabilize such an inclusion and determine the degree of solubility of the benzodiazepines in sodium salicylate solution. Nevertheless, further studies are necessary to substantiate these results. {\textcopyright} 1983.},

abstract = {Hypothesis: The relaxation time in viscoelastic surfactant solutions is a function of temperature, salt/surfactant concentrations, resting conditions, as well as shear frequency. The simplistic assumption of a single and constant relaxation time is not representative of all relaxation modes in these solutions especially at high frequencies. Experiments: Steady-state and oscillatory measurements are carried out to study the effects of high temperature, concentration and resting condition on the rheology of surfactants/salt mixtures including a non-ionic and a zwitterionic/anionic surfactant system. Furthermore, a novel semi-empirical rheological model is deducted based on Cates theory. This model introduces, for the first time, a frequency-dependence for the continuous relaxation time spectrum. Findings: At high temperatures, the non-ionic surfactant become more viscoelastic and the zwitterionic/anionic system loses its viscoelasticity. The addition of surfactant/salt improves the viscoelasticity of both systems, and, for the zwitterionic/anionic mixture, increasing the resting temperature improves its viscoelasticity. In addition, the proposed model significantly improves predictions of traditional Maxwell model for different viscoelastic surfactant solutions (using data from this study and the literature) for a considerable range of surfactant and salt combinations at a wide range of temperature.},

abstract = {DNA sequence represents a single format onto which a broad range of biological phenomena can be projected for high-throughput data collection. Over the past three years, massively parallel DNA sequencing platforms have become widely available, reducing the cost of DNA sequencing by over two orders of magnitude, and democratizing the field by putting the sequencing capacity of a major genome center in the hands of individual investigators. These new technologies are rapidly evolving, and near-term challenges include the development of robust protocols for generating sequencing libraries, building effective new approaches to data-analysis, and often a rethinking of experimental design. Next-generation DNA sequencing has the potential to dramatically accelerate biological and biomedical research, by enabling the comprehensive analysis of genomes, transcriptomes and interactomes to become inexpensive, routine and widespread, rather than requiring significant production-scale efforts.},

Particularly, novel approaches for the formation of functionalized poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) layers as hydrophilic outer shell were focused to attain receptor-mediated drug and gene delivery through PEG-conjugated ligands with a minimal non-specific interaction with other proteins. Surface organization of block copolymer micelles with cross-linking core was also described from a standpoint of the preparation of a new functional surface-coating with a unique macromolecular architecture. The micelle-attached surface and the thin hydrogel layer made by layered micelles exhibited nonfouling properties and worked as the reservoir for hydrophobic reagents. Furthermore, the potential utility of multimolecular assembly derived from heterobifunctional PEGs and block copolymers were explored to systematically modify the properties of metal and semiconductor nanostructures by controlling their structure and their surface properties, making them extremely attractive for use in biological and biomedical applications. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

Rheological measurements and cryogenic transmission electron microscopy (cryo-TEM) were conducted to study the rheological properties and microstructures of wormlike micelles. Cryo-TEM image confirms the formation of wormlike micelles in aqueous solution. Rheological results show that wormlike micelles indicate linear viscoelasticity and follow the Maxwell model. The Cole-Cole plots agree well with the typical characteristic of the Maxwell model at low and middle frequencies. The contour length, mesh size, and entanglement length of wormlike micelles are estimated from the rheological measurements. In addition, the temperature effect on the rheological properties of wormlike micelles is also studied. Through comparison, the entanglement length and mesh size of wormlike micelles are nearly unchanged, while the contour length shows a sharp decrease tendency with the increase of temperature, indicating that the change of rheological properties with the temperature is due to the contour length change of wormlike micelles.},

Combining the fields of chemistry, physics, polymer science, and nanotechnology, its primary focus is on the design, formulation, and processing of intelligent viscoelastic surfactant solutions, covering the scientific principles governing responsiveness to one or more particular triggers, down to the end-use-driven functions. The first chapter explains why and how surfactants self-assemble into viscoelastic wormlike micellar solutions reminiscent of polymer solutions, while the following chapters show how the response to a given trigger translates into macroscopic rheological changes, including temperature, light, pH, CO2, redox, hydrocarbon, etc. The last chapter demonstrates the applications of these viscoelastic assemblies in oil and gas production, drag reduction, biomaterials, cleaning processes, electrorheological and photorheological fluids. Comments and perspectives are provided at the end to conclude this Brief. This Brief is aimed at chemists, physicists, chemical engineers and nano-scientists who are involved in self-assemblies and applications of surfactants, as well as graduates in physical chemistry.

Because spontaneous self-assembly and interfacial properties are the result of a delicate balance between hydrophobic interactions and polar-head interactions, a structural characterization is essential for a complete and full understanding of base-base properties in the aggregates, as observed by spectroscopic techniques. Small-angle neutron scattering, static light scattering, and quasi-elastic light scattering have been employed to assess the structural evolution of the binary system as the lipid concentration is increased. The data indicate the presence of rather flexible elongated aggregates, whose local structure is cylindrical and remains essentially unchanged during micellar growth. Scattering data are fully supported by cryo-TEM analysis. The results are consistent with micellar unidimensional growth to giant wormlike aggregates that eventually entangle to form a transient network with a response to mechanical stress that is similar to that of polymer solutions in the semidilute range. Such aggregates are known as polymerlike micelles to stress the similarity with the behavior of macromolecules in good solvents. In our case, the correspondence is not limited to a mesosocopic structural scale because from a chemical point of view each monomer contains a nucleic acid functionality that is also expressed in the polymerlike aggregates whose biopolymeric counterpart is in fact a polynucleotide. Therefore, these new aggregates can be considered to be the first example of an "associative polynucleotide".},

@article{Zilman2002a,
abstract = {We study a generic model of self-assembling chains that can branch and form networks with branching points (junctions) of arbitrary functionality. The physical realizations include physical gels, wormlike micelles, dipolar fluids, and microemulsions. The model maps the partition function of a solution of branched, self-assembling, mutually avoiding clusters onto that of a Heisenberg magnet in the mathematical limit of zero spin components. As for the calculation of thermodynamic properties as well as the scattering structure factor, the mapping rigorously accounts for all possible cluster configurations, except for closed rings. The model is solved in the mean-field approximation. It is found that despite the absence of any specific interaction between the chains, the presence of the junctions induces an effective attraction between the monomers, which in the case of threefold junctions leads to a first-order reentrant phase separation between a dilute phase consisting mainly of single chains, and a dense network, or two network phases. The model is then modified to predict the structural properties at the mean-field level. Independent of the phase separation, we predict a percolation (connectivity) transition at which an infinite network is formed. The percolation transition partially overlaps with the first-order transition, and is a continuous, nonthermodynamic transition that describes a change in the topology of the system. Our treatment that predicts both the thermodynamic phase equilibria as well as the spatial correlations in the system allows us to treat both the phase separation and the percolation threshold within the same framework. The density-density correlation has the usual Ornstein-Zernicke form at low monomer densities. At higher densities, a peak emerges in the structure factor, signifying the onset of medium-range order in the system. Implications of the results for different physical systems are discussed.},

Two scattering functions of semiflexible chains incorporating excluded volume effects, with and without the intermicellar interactions, were used in SANS data model fitting. Two needed changes were made in the well-accepted models. Extensive and systematic SANS data analysis suggests the robustness of these corrected scattering functions when the intermicellar interactions are included. The influence of the headgroups and ionic strength on the contour length and micellar flexibility of these two systems was demonstrated on the basis of the quantitative structural information obtained from the model fitting. Micellar flexibility was found to depend on surfactant concentration, even when intermicellar interactions were taken into account, despite predictions to the contrary.},

abstract = {The influence of simple structural modification on the solubility of a series of poorly soluble benzodiazepines in sodium salicylate solution was investigated. Results of solubility and spectral studies indicate that an electrostatic force of the donor-acceptor type plays an important role in the solubilization of these compounds by hydrotropy. In an attempt to explain the characteristic positive deviation in hydrotropic solubilization diagrams, the solution properties of sodium salicylate were studied. Conductivity experiments indicate molecular aggregation of sodium salicylate at a concentration of 0.67 M at 25°C. The aggregation concentration increases as a function of temperature. Results obtained from density, viscosity and diffusion studies are consistent with those of conductivity measurements. The remarkable increase in the solubilizing effect of sodium salicylate is probably associated with aggregate formation. Inclusion of the benzodiazepine molecules in the sodium salicylate aggregates is thought to be the mechanism responsible for the solubilization of these drugs. A donor-acceptor interaction between sodium salicylate and benzodiazepine molecules is assumed to stabilize such an inclusion and determine the degree of solubility of the benzodiazepines in sodium salicylate solution. Nevertheless, further studies are necessary to substantiate these results. {\textcopyright} 1983.},

The structures and modes of formation of the self-assembled fibrillar networks (SAFINs) that immobilize the liquid components of the gels are discussed experimentally and theoretically. The spectroscopic, rheological, and structural features of the different classes of LMOGs are also presented. Many examples of the application of the principal analytical techniques for investigation of molecular gels (including SANS, SAXS, WAXS, UV-vis absorption, fluorescence and CD spectroscopies, scanning electron, transmission electron and optical microscopies, and molecular modeling) are presented didactically and in-depth, as are several of the theories of the stages of aggregation of individual LMOG molecules leading to SAFINs. Several actual and potential applications of molecular gels in disparate fields (from silicate replication of nanostructures to art conservation) are described. Special emphasis is placed on perspectives for future developments. This book is an invaluable resource for researchers and practitioners either already researching self-assembly and soft matter or new to the area.

abstract = {In this article, we consider the effects of sodium salicylate on the microstructure evolution and rheological responses of an aqueous cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) solution. The experimental runs covered CTAB solutions ranging from dilute to semidilute, which were far above its critical micelle concentration. Sodium salicylate (NaSal) was used as a structure-forming agent with the molar ratio of NaSal to CTAB ranging from 0.1 to 10.0. The experimental results showed that the rheological responses of the surfactant solution were influenced strongly by both the CTAB concentration and the molar ratio. At low molar ratios, below 0.3, the surfactant solutions behaved like a Newtonian fluid. However, as the molar ratio increased, the deviation from Newtonian behavior became pronounced. Specifically, for 0.05 M CTAB solutions with molar ratios ranging from 1.0 to 5.0, an apparent yield stress developed at low shear rates and a stress plateau was displayed at intermediate shear rates. When the shear rate exceeded a certain threshold value, the shear stress increased, again passing over the plateau value. In addition, viscoelastic response and relaxation behavior were observed. The relaxation behavior after the cessation of flow was strongly dependent on the molar ratio, which was also confirmed by rheo-optical observations. The optical anisotropy measured by rheo-optical methods was closely related to flow-induced stretching and alignment of the wormy micelles and was consistent with the rheological responses.

abstract = {The effect of different hydrotropic salts on the microenvironment at the anionic head group region of sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) micelle has been studied through time-resolved fluorescence anisotropy measurements of a solubilized probe, coumarin-153 (C153). The organic cations of the hydrotropic salts used in this study, i.e. aniline hydrochloride (AHC) and o-, m- and p-toluidine hydrochlorides (OTHC, MTHC and PTHC, respectively), differ in their charge to size ratio and hydrophobicity. Present study utilizes the sensitivity of the fluorescence technique to understand the changes in the micropolarity and microviscosity experienced by the fluorescent probe, C153, solubilized in the micellar Stern layer, on addition of different hydrotropic salts. Significant changes are observed in the rotational relaxation dynamics of the probe with increasing concentration of the salts. The changes in the rotational relaxation dynamics clearly reflect the sphere to rod transition in the SDS micelles and correspond nicely with the reported results from dynamic light scattering measurements. The growth behavior of SDS micelles is found to be sensitive to the hydrophobicity of the organic cations. The charge to size ratio of the organic cations also indicated to play a role in inducing the sphere to rod transition in the SDS micelles. The interesting observation made from this study is that the sphere to rod transition of SDS micelles is largely facilitated by the presence of the hydrotropic salts and such a transition is successfully indicated by the simple fluorescence anisotropy measurements of a probe in the micelle carried out in the presence of different hydrotropic salts. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Rheological properties of alkyl dicarboxylic acid-alkylamine complex systems have been characterized. The complex materials employed in this study consist of an amino acid-based surfactant (dodecanoylglutamic acid, C12Glu) and a tertiary alkylamine (dodecyldimethylamine, C12DMA) or a secondary alkylamine (dodecylmethylamine, C12MA). (1)H NMR and mass spectroscopic data have suggested that C12Glu forms a stoichiometric 1:1 complex with C12DMA and C12MA. Rheological measurements have suggested that the complex systems yield viscoelastic wormlike micellar solutions and the rheological behavior is strongly dependent on the aqueous solution pH. This pH-dependent behavior results from the structural transformation of the wormlike micelles to occur in the narrow pH range 5.5-6.2 (in the case of C12Glu-C12DMA system); i.e., positive curved aggregates such as spherical or rodlike micelles tend to be formed at high pH values. Our current study offers a unique way to obtain viscoelastic wormlike micellar solutions by means of alkyl dicarboxylic acid-alkylamine complex as gemini-like amphiphiles.},

The variable composition of Prussian blue has tantalized chemists, until investigations by X-ray crystallography in the late 20th century determined its structure. The open 'zeolytic' lattice can act as host to small molecules and ions, making the substance useful as an antidote to certain poisons, notably thallium and radiocaesium. The redox chemistry of the 'mixed valence' iron atoms in Prussian blue confers the property of electrochromism on the solid, which can therefore serve in electronic digital displays. Photochemical production of the pigment is the basis for the cyanotype or blueprint reprographic process. Inclusion of redox-active species in the Prussian blue lattice can 'fine-tune' its color, by shifting the electronic charge transfer band in the visible absorption spectrum. Thus, photographic artists unknowingly employ coordination chemistry to tone the hues of their cyanotypes.

abstract = {Abstract: The flow in a pipe of wormlike micellar solutions is examined using a simple model that consists of the codeformational Maxwell constitutive equation and a kinetic equation that accounts for the breaking and reformation of micelles. The model needs six parameters, all of which are extracted from single independent rheological experiments. One of the parameters, the shear-banding intensity parameter is associated with the stress plateau in the shear-banding region. The stress plateau is set in our model by the criterion of equal extended Gibbs free energy of the bands. The model predicts a Newtonian (parabolic profile) flow at low-shear rates or low-pressure gradients, followed by shear thinning up to a critical rate where instabilities and long transients appear. At this critical shear rate, a shear-banding flow region arises near the pipe wall. The model indicates that tube lengths up to 400 diameters are required to obtain fully developed flow, where a pluglike profile at the center of the tube coexists with a region supporting a much higher shear rate next to the wall. Shear-banding flow is present up to a second critical shear rate. At shear rates larger than the second critical rate, the parabolic velocity profile is recovered, except near the center of the tube where a small shear-banding flow region remains because the stress at that radial position is equal to the plateau stress. This is a consequence of the linear dependence of the shear stress with the pipe radius. The predictions of the model are compared with experimental results from the literature.},

abstract = {The topology of self-assembled surfactant solutions includes varying degrees of micellar branching, ranging from linear wormlike micelles to a micellar network. Micellar branching acts as an effective attraction between micelles such that network condensation can lead to phase separation. Unlike chemical branching in polymers, micellar branches are labile. Movement of branches along a micelle contour has therefore been proposed as a mechanism of stress relaxation that leads to a reduction in the structural relaxation time and thus, the zero-shear viscosity. Branching is also thought to suppress flow alignment, and for lower levels of branching, may also suppress instabilities such as shear banding. The suppression of shear banding can lead to a lesser degree of shear-thinning in the apparent viscosity at higher shear rates, as well as a reduction in extensional thickening. However, for higher levels of branching, shear can induce branching for samples in proximity to such a phase transition, which can result in shear banding due to shear-induced phase separation. Recent modeling and simulations of the energetics of branching, as well as experiments on model systems, show that the reduction in zero-shear viscosity is due to micelle branching. Current research includes efforts to develop a more mechanistic, quantitative understanding of micellar branching and more generally, its effects on micellar solution rheology.},

abstract = {The micellar system composed of Cetylpyridinium Chloride-Sodium Salicylate (CPyCl-NaSal) in brine aqueous solutions has been studied by systematically changing the salt concentration, in order to investigate the rheology of the arising morphologies. In particular, the zero-shear viscosity and the linear viscoelastic response have been measured as a function of the NaSal concentration (with [CPyCl] = 100 mM). The Newtonian viscosity shows a nonmonotonic dependence upon concentration, passing through a maximum at NaSal/CPyCl approximate to 0.6, and eventually dropping at higher salt concentrations. The progressive addition of salt determines first a transition from a Newtonian to a purely Maxwell-like behavior as the length of the micelles significantly increases. Beyond the peak viscosity, the viscoelastic data show two distinct features. On the one hand, the main relaxation time of the system strongly decreases, while the plateau modulus remains essentially constant. Calculations based on the rheological data show that, as the binding salt concentration increases, there is a decrease in micelles breaking rate and a decrease in their average length. On the other hand, in the same concentration region, a low-frequency elastic plateau is measured. Such a plateau is considered as the signature of a tenuous, but persistent branched network, whose existence is confirmed by cryo-transmission electron microscopy images.

abstract = {The structure of solutions of cetylpyridinium chlorate micelles is studied by light scattering and found to be analogous to that of polymer solutions in good solvent and in the semi dilute range. In contrast the micellar solutions are found here to be very fluid and their measured rheological properties are strikingly different from that of polymer solutions. These rheological properties are not accounted for by the recently developed model for semi dilute solutions of equilibrium polymers which described well the properties of other similar wormlike micellar systems. We suggest that the existence of crosslinks rather than entanglement points in the network of wormlike micelles could be responsible for these unexpected properties.},

Each formed a viscous fluid in water at low concentration in the absence of a salt. In solutions of 14-4-14 MEA, the formation of highly viscoelastic wormlike micelles could be detected using steady and dynamic rheological measurements. The existence of these long column micelles has also been confirmed using cryo-transmission electron microscopy (cryo-TEM) and small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). Compared with conventional bis(dimethylalkylammonium) bromide Gemini molecules with the same spacer (14-4-14), 14-4-14 MEA demonstrated a better ability to fabricate wormlike micelles because of the change in the headgroup structure. As for 16-4-16 MEA, which has longer alkyl chains, its aqueous solutions behave more like elastic gels at a concentration of 80 mmol L-1. The unique viscoelastic behavior of m-4-m MEA in water can be attributed to the synergistic interactions of hydrophobic attraction and hydrogen bonding. The obtained results are believed to be an important addition to the effect that the headgroups of Gemini surfactants have on their aggregation behavior in dilute solutions.},

The glycerol can also be replaced by other co-solvents like butylenglycol. Above T m, the PC spontaneously forms L ? phases with multilamellar vesicles that show a strong stationary birefringence. On cooling below T m, the L ? phases jellify to transparent gels. DSC measurements of the gels show that the PC molecules undergo a phase transition into the crystalline state. This transition does not seem to be accompanied by a change of the morphological structure of the liquid L ? phase. The hydrogels also have a stationary birefringence. The vesicles in the gels have been imaged by the CryoTEM method. The hydrogels are already formed with as little as 1{\%} of PC in the mixed solvent. The rheological properties of the gels were determined from oscillating rheological measurements. Samples with 10{\%} of PC have a storage modulus of {\textgreater}10,000 Pa. ?

Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) has been used to study the effect of the added NaCl on the critical micelle concentration, cmc, and enthalpy of micellization, $\Delta$micHo, between 278.15 and 318.15 K. Gibbs free energy, $\Delta$micGo, and entropy, $\Delta$micSo, were deduced by taking into account the counterion binding. From the temperature dependence of $\Delta$micHothe heat capacities of micellization, $\Delta$miccpo, were determined. NaCl shifts cmc strongly towards lower values, indicating the screening of the repulsions of the polar head groups by counterions; but it influences $\Delta$micHoat higher concentrations of salt only. $\Delta$micGois always negative and slightly temperature dependent. The temperature dependence of $\Delta$micSoindicates that the process of micellization is entropically driven. $\Delta$micHodecreases strongly with increasing temperature and passes through zero (endothermic to exothermic processes). The temperature dependence of the critical micelle concentration exhibits a minimum characterized by $\Delta$micHo= 0, where $\Delta$micGois of purely entropic contribution in all solutions. $\Delta$miccpoare strongly negative in all solvents, relating directly to the removal of water accessible non-polar surface of DTAC in the presence of excess counterions also. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {In this article, we investigate the effect of hydrocarbon addition on the rheological properties and structure of wormlike micellar solutions of potassium oleate. We show that a viscoelastic solution of entangled micellar chains is extremely responsive to hydrocarbons-the addition of only 0.5 wt {\%} n-dodecane results in a drastic drop in viscosity by up to 5 orders of magnitude, which is due to the complete disruption of micelles and the formation of microemulsion droplets. We study the whole range of the transition of wormlike micelles into microemulsion droplets and discover that it can be divided into three regions: (i) in the first region, the solutions retain a high viscosity (similar to 10-350 Pa.s), the micelles are entangled but their length is reduced by the solubilization of hydrocarbons; (ii) in the second region, the system transitions to the unentangled regime and the viscosity sharply decreases as a result of further micelle shortening and the appearance of microemulsion droplets; (iii) in the third region, the viscosity is low (similar to 0.001 Pa.s) and only microemulsion droplets remain in the solution. The experimental studies were accompanied by theoretical considerations, which allowed us to reveal for the first time that (i) one of the leading mechanisms of micelle shortening is the preferential accumulation of the solubilized hydrocarbon in the spherical end caps of wormlike micelles, which makes the end caps thermodynamically more favorable; (ii) the onset of the sharp drop in viscosity is correlated with the crossover from the entangled to unentangled regime of the wormlike micellar solution taking place upon the shortening of micellar chains; and (iii) in the unentangled regime short cylindrical micelles coexist with microemulsion droplets.},

For a fixed composition of 97/3 CTAT/SDBS, the zero-shear viscosity eta (0) initially increases rapidly with surfactant concentration, but decreases beyond an intermediate concentration phi (max). The solutions show a scattering peak in SANS and the height of the scattering peak also exhibits a maximum around phi (max). These results are interpreted in terms of a maximum in the linear micellar contour length (L) over bar at phi (max), and suggest that the hydrodynamic and electrostatic correlation lengths reach an optimal ratio at this point. For a fixed total surfactant concentration, the viscosity eta (0) also reaches a maximum at an intermediate SDBS fraction. The decrease in eta (0) at high SDBS fractions is interpreted in terms of the polyelectrolyte nature of the micelles and the increased chain flexibility caused by the rising ionic strength of the solutions. An alternate possibility may involve a progression from linear to branched micelles with increasing SDBS content.},

Resistance to metronidazole has been described, and treatment failures can occur in up to 20{\%} of cases, making development of alternative antigiardials an important goal. To this end, we have screened a chemical library of 746 approved human drugs and 164 additional bioactive compounds for activity against Giardia lamblia. We identified 56 compounds that caused significant inhibition of G. lamblia growth and attachment. Of these, 15 were previously reported to have antigiardial activity, 20 were bioactive but not approved for human use, and 21 were drugs approved for human use for other indications. One notable compound of the last group was the antirheumatic drug auranofin. Further testing revealed that auranofin was active in the low (4 to 6)-micromolar range against a range of divergent G. lamblia isolates representing both human-pathogenic assemblages A and B. Most importantly, auranofin was active against multiple metronidazole-resistant strains. Mechanistically, auranofin blocked the activity of giardial thioredoxin oxidoreductase, a critical enzyme involved in maintaining normal protein function and combating oxidative damage, suggesting that this inhibition contributes to the antigiardial activity. Furthermore, auranofin was efficacious in vivo, as it eradicated infection with different G. lamblia isolates in different rodent models. These results indicate that the approved human drug auranofin could be developed as a novel agent in the armamentarium of antigiardial drugs, particularly against metronidazole-resistant strains.},
