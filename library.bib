 abstract = {The absolute fluorescent quantum efficiency of sodium salicylate was measured by two different methods and found to be 0.99$\pm$40.03 fluorescent quanta emitted per incident ultraviolet quantum at 2537 {\AA }. Measurements were also made at 1216 and 1611 {\AA } by one of the methods, and the quantum efficiency was found to be 0.94 at both wavelengths. The energy conversion efficiency was found to be 0.57 at 2537 {\AA }, 0.35 at 1611 {\AA }, and 0.26 at 1216 {\AA }. The angular distribution of fluorescence and the quantum efficiency were found to depend upon salicylate thickness. The quantum efficiency displays a broad maximum for thicknesses in the range 2-4 mg/cm2. and the angular distribution follows closely a cosine law in this thickness range.},

 abstract = {A biphasic solution containing water and precip-itated phosphocholine (PC) is presented in order to investi-gate the consequences of 1,3-butanediol addition on the phase behavior of PC at different 1,3-butanediol concentra-tions and temperature values. With increasing the concen-tration of 1,3-butanediol in the mixed solvent at room temperature, the biphasic solution converts into turbid phase, two phase, and finally to a clear phase that is bire-fringent when viewed between two crossed polarizers. The birefringent phase moves to lower 1,3-butanediol contents at higher temperature values. The birefringent phase was ob-served via polarizing microscopy, and its rheological param-eters were measured with cone plate method. In high 1,3-butanediol contents, solutions with 2.5{\%} of PC behave as a gel with high yield stress value. The micellization of cetyl-trimethyammonium bromide (CTAB) in a series of 1,3-butanediol/water mixed solvent at room temperature was also investigated. From the conductivity measurements, the critical micelle concentration and the degree of counterion dissociation of CTAB were obtained as a function of 1,3-butanediol. Standard free energy of micellization, as a func-tion of 1,3-butanediol contents, was also estimated and discussed. Gibbs energies of micellization were found to have a good correlation with dielectric constant and Gordon parameters.},

 abstract = {The effects of urea on the micellization properties of a poly(ethylene oxide)-block-poly(propylene oxide)-block-poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO-PPO-PEO) copolymer (commercially available as Pluronic P105) and on the structure and microenvironment of the micelles are reported. Critical micellization concentration (cmc) and temperature (cmt) values for the amphiphilic block copolymer dissolved in urea/water mixtures (urea concentration 0, 1, 2, and 4 M) were obtained using a dye solubilization method and corroborated with data from surface tension, density, and fluorescence spectroscopy experiments. Urea increased the cmc and cmt of the PEO-PPO-PEO copolymer; the effect of urea on the cmt was more pronounced at low copolymer concentrations and diminished at concentrations of similar to 2.5{\%}. The thermodynamic parameters of micelle formation in the presence of urea were estimated using a closed association model; the enthalpy of micellization was positive (endothermic) and decreased upon increasing the urea concentration. The surface activity and the partial specific volume of the block copolymer decreased with an increase in the urea concentration, whereas the hydrodynamic radii of the copolymer micelles, determined using dynamic light scattering, remained unaffected by the presence of 4 M urea in the solution. The micropolarity in copolymer solutions in urea/water was probed as a function of temperature using the I-1/I-3 intensity ratio of the pyrene vibrational fine structure recorded in fluorescence emission spectra; a small decrease in the micropolarity of the micelle core was observed in the presence of urea. The microviscosity in the micelle interior, estimated from the intramolecular excimer fluorescence of the hydrophobic probe bis(1-pyrenylmethyl) ether (dipyme), also exhibited a small decrease with an increase in the urea concentration. The findings presented here are discussed in the context of the molecular mechanism underlying the effects of urea.},

 abstract = {A versatile procedure to calculate two-dimensional scattering patterns of oriented systems is presented. The systems are represented by a set of dummy atoms with different scattering length densities, which allows the construction of very complex shapes either for single particles or for sets of particles. By the use of oriented pair distance distribution functions it is possible to perform a fast calculation of the scattering intensity from the oriented system in a given direction in the scattering vector ( q ) space and generate the two-dimensional scattering pattern on a given q plane. Several examples of the calculations are presented, demonstrating the method and its applicability. The presented results open new possibilities for the analysis of scattering patters obtained from oriented systems.},

 abstract = {Alkylimidazolium salts are a very important class of compounds. So far, calorimetry has hardly been used to characterize their solution behaviour. The enthalpies obtained from indirect methods have an intrinsic large uncertainty, and nowadays it is clear that calorimetry is the most sensitive technique for directly measuring the thermodynamic properties of aggregation. In this work, isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) was used along with conductivity to determine the thermodynamics of aggregation of 1-alkyl-3-methylimidazolium chlorides ([Cnmim]Cl, n = 8, 10, 12, and 14) in aqueous solution. The critical micelle concentrations, cmc, were obtained from conductivity and calorimetry, and the enthalpies of micelle formation, $\Delta$Hmic, were derived from the calorimetric titrations. From conductivity, we could also derive the values for the degree of ionisation of the micelles ($\alpha$), the molar conductivity ($\Lambda$M) of the [Cnmim]Cl micellar species and the molar conductivity at infinite dilution ($\Lambda $$\infty $) for the [Cnmim]+cations. Values are therefore reported for the enthalpy ($\Delta$Hmic), the Gibbs free energy ($\Delta$Gmic) and entropy ($\Delta$Smic) changes for micelle formation. Further, the aggregate sizes and aggregation numbers were obtained by light scattering (LS) measurements. The observed variation of the thermodynamic properties with the alkyl chain length is discussed in detail and compared with the traditional cationic surfactants 1-alkyl-trimethylammonium chlorides, [CnTA]Cl. The difference in the values of the thermodynamic parameters for both types of surfactants is here related to the structure of their head groups. {\copyright } 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

 abstract = {We report an investigation on the aggregation of 1,2-dilauroyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidyluridine (DLPU), a surfactant molecule that merges the self-assembling properties of lecithins with the molecular recognition characteristics of nucleic bases in a phosphate-buffered aqueous solution at physiological pH and as a function of lipid concentration. Because spontaneous self-assembly and interfacial properties are the result of a delicate balance between hydrophobic interactions and polar-head interactions, a structural characterization is essential for a complete and full understanding of base-base properties in the aggregates, as observed by spectroscopic techniques. Small-angle neutron scattering, static light scattering, and quasi-elastic light scattering have been employed to assess the structural evolution of the binary system as the lipid concentration is increased. The data indicate the presence of rather flexible elongated aggregates, whose local structure is cylindrical and remains essentially unchanged during micellar growth. Scattering data are fully supported by cryo-TEM analysis. The results are consistent with micellar unidimensional growth to giant wormlike aggregates that eventually entangle to form a transient network with a response to mechanical stress that is similar to that of polymer solutions in the semidilute range. Such aggregates are known as polymerlike micelles to stress the similarity with the behavior of macromolecules in good solvents. In our case, the correspondence is not limited to a mesosocopic structural scale because from a chemical point of view each monomer contains a nucleic acid functionality that is also expressed in the polymerlike aggregates whose biopolymeric counterpart is in fact a polynucleotide. Therefore, these new aggregates can be considered to be the first example of an "associative polynucleotide".},

Varying the weight percent, phi, of surfactants from 0.1 {\%} to 10 {\%}, both dilute and semidilute regimes were studied. Above the crossover concentration phi* approximately 0.3 {\%}, the viscoelastic properties are described by an almost ideal Maxwell relaxator. The overall rheological data are found to scale with the surfactant concentration with exponents close to those predicted from a recent stress relaxation model applied to living polymers. In addition, at high angular frequency, the complex elastic modulus results are interpreted in terms of crossover between the regimes of reversible scission and of breathing of the polymer-like chains.

 abstract = {We considered the mutual influence of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) and methanol, ethanol as well as 1-propanol on their behaviour in the aqueous solution. This consideration was based on the surface tension, density, viscosity and conductivity measurements of the aqueous solutions of CTAB and alcohol mixture at 293. K in the whole range of alcohol concentration and in the presence of the surfactant in the monomeric and aggregated forms in the solution. Additionally, the dynamic light scattering measurements were made at the surfactant and alcohol concentration at which the aggregation of their molecules can be expected. CTAB practically does not influence the possibility of the formation of the small aggregates of alcohols and slightly affects the partial and apparent molar volumes of water and alcohols, but alcohols considerably affect the critical micelle concentration (CMC) of CTAB and the degree of counterions bound to its micelles. The mixed micelles of CTAB and methanol are probably formed in the whole range of alcohol concentration but those of CTAB and ethanol or 1-propanol only in their concentration range in which they are present in the monomeric form in the solution. {\copyright } 2013 Elsevier B.V..},

 abstract = {This paper describes the influence of counterions on the unidirectional growth of micelles formed by alkylpyridinium surfactants in aqueous solution. It is shown that the growth of spherical micelles to form wormlike micelles is strongly dependent on counterion structure. More hydrophobic counterions induce the formation of wormlike micelles at lower surfactant concentrations. Next to hydrophobicity and the type of substituent, the substitution pattern of the aromatic ring plays the most important role in micellar growth. The formation of a network of entangled, elongated wormlike micelles by alkylpyridinium surfactants with o-hydroxybenzoate and p-chlorobenzoate counterions is discussed in terms of surfactant structure. It is concluded that, next to counterion structure, the microenvironment of the counterion (substituent) in the Stern region and the structure of the surfactant monomer (i.e., the surfactant cation) play the most important role in the formation of these elongated wormlike micelles. Headgroup effects are proposed to be the main driving force for this phenomenon.},

 abstract = {The science of the flow of matter very early got off to a brave start, when the Greek philosopher Heraclitus announced that " everything flows. " The flow of water in pipes, the plasticity of clay and bronze, even the flow of the sand in the " hour glass " offered a challenge to investigators, but progress has not kept pace with the demands of science and industry. Surely no one would think of consulting a work on hydraulics in designing a new alloy, artificial textile or lacquer. What has been the matter? Certainly cats' backs and thunderstorms could hardly have presented so promising a subject for the investigator at the beginning, for electricity is invisible; yet the science of the flow of electricity has never faltered and a host of volumes are required for its exposition, while the science of the flow of matter has lagged at the starting post. In fact, were one to speak of the science of matter as we speak of the science of electricity, no one would know what was being referred to. So an entirely new term for the science of flow was suggested at the Third Plasticity Symposium, the name rheology, which I am adopting here. It needs to be pointed out at once that ordinary flow in streams and pipes is indeed hydraulic and it is this type of flow which engaged much of the attention of the early investigators, including many of the most cele-brated, such as Galileo, Newton, Napier, and Bernouilli. They observed that hydraulic flow is turbulent flow and quite complex in character but it was only in 1846 that the simpler linear fluid flow was demonstrated by the Frenchman, Poiseuille. He was a physiologist interested in the flow of blood in the capillaries of the body but most of his experiments were made with water in glass capillaries and he thus discovered by accident that flow in very narrow channels or at low velocities is linear in character, giving a simple type of flow. This type of flow had been suggested by Newton but not demonstrated. The difference between hydraulic flow and fluid flow may be stated very simply, for the resistance to hydraulic flow increases nearly as the square of the velocity but the resistance to linear fluid flow increases merely as the first power of the velocity. This law is to the flow of matter what Ohm's Law is to the flow of electricity, i. e., it is simple and exact and upon it rests the development of the science of fluid flow. It may be stated in the " elegant language of mathematics " as:},

 abstract = {Rheology is, by common consent, a difficult subject and some of the theoretical components are often viewed as being of prohibitive complexity by scientists without a strong mathematical background. There are also the difficulties inherent in any multidisciplinary science like rheology for those with a specific training. Therefore, newcomers to the field are sometimes discouraged, and for them the existing texts on the subject - some of which are outstanding - are of limited assistance because of their depth of detail and highly mathematical nature. This book introduces the subject of rheology in terms understandable to non-experts and describes the application of rheological principles to many industrial products and processes. It provides a simple but authoritative guide which shows clearly how mathematics, physics and chemistry have contributed to the development of rheology. The generic features of all liquid-like materials are summarised, i.e. viscosity, linear viscoelasticity, normal stresses and extensional viscosity. Particular systems are then discussed, i.e. polymeric liquids and suspensions. The final chapter gives an outline of the theoretical advances which have been made. Consistent notation and nomenclature have been used throughout the book, and the key textbooks and publications which will enable the reader to follow up particular topics are listed.},

Quenching is observed with all the hydrocarbons except perylene, indicating that the fluorescence lifetime has little effect on the quenching behaviour. The fact that quenching is observed even with the short-lived azulene S2 fluorescence rules out a quenching mechanism involving diffusion of aromatic hydrocarbon from the centre of the micelle to the micellar surface. The behaviour can, however, be explained on the basis of a channel model in which the aromatic hydrocarbon distorts the micellar structure to produce a water-filled channel down which quencher ions can penetrate. Stern-Volmer plots for the quenching are non-linear, partly due to the fact that the concentration of bromide ion in the Stern layer is not directly proportional to the total bromide concentration. In addition, it is suggested that contributions to the quenching from aromatic hydrocarbon in both micellar and aqueous phases are important."

 abstract = {Giant micelles are elongated, polymer-like objects created by the self-assembly of amphiphilic molecules ( such as detergents) in solution. Giant micelles are typically flexible, and can become highly entangled even at modest concentrations. The resulting viscoelastic solutions show fascinating flow behaviour (rheology) which we address theoretically in this article at two levels. First, we summarize advances in understanding linear viscoelastic spectra and steady-state nonlinear flows, based on microscopic constitutive models that combine the physics of polymer entanglement with the reversible kinetics of self-assembly. Such models were first introduced two decades ago, and since then have been shown to explain robustly several distinctive features of the rheology in the strongly entangled regime, including extreme shear thinning. We then turn to more complex rheological phenomena, particularly involving spatial heterogeneity, spontaneous oscillation, instability and chaos. Recent understanding of these complex flows is based largely on grossly simplified models which capture in outline just a few pertinent microscopic features, such as coupling between stresses and other order parameters such as concentration. The role of 'structural memory' ( the dependence of structural parameters such as the micellar length distribution on the flow history) in explaining these highly nonlinear phenomena is addressed. Structural memory also plays an intriguing role in the little-understood shear thickening regime, which occurs in a concentration regime close to but below the onset of strong entanglement, and which is marked by a shear-induced transformation from an inviscid to a gelatinous state.},

Fundamentally, the behavior is associated with the balance of charge between the surfactant and the aromatic anion. In this paper, the same approach was used to investigate the rheological behavior of WLM formed when solutions of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (C16TAB) and ortho-hydroxycinnamate (OHCA) are combined. This co-solute has two ionizable groups, with pKas of 4.15 and 9.71. In order to verify the influence of the two ionic forms of OHCA on the rheological behavior, solutions of C16TAB and OHCA were studied on three pHs, 7, 8, and 9. The results are analyzed by considering the reptation and breaking-recombination mechanisms.},

 abstract = {Hypothesis It is known that additives like glycerol and sucrose lead to the swelling of aqueous bilayer L$\alpha$ phases. The swelling of the L$\alpha$ phases can be explained by the increase of the refractive index of the mixed solvent, which lowers the van der Waals attraction between the bilayers. Afterwards, the undulation forces between the bilayers can push them apart. This hypothesis was previously extended to wormlike micelles (WLM) of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) and sodium salicylate (NaSal). These types of self-assembly structures have viscoelastic properties, and the zero shear viscosity of these solutions is dependent on the molar ratio NaSal/CTAB, R. At R = 0.6, R = 1.0 and R $\approx$ 2.6 the viscosity goes, respectively, through a maximum, a minimum and another maximum. These viscosities can be explained by differences in relaxation mechanisms predominant in each region. Similarly to what is observed to bilayer L$\alpha$ phases, the additives would change the interaction between the WLM, affecting the relaxation processes of each region, altering the profile from two maxima and one minimum to a single maximum in viscosity. In the present manuscript, it is investigated whether it is only the refractive index, other solvent properties, or a combination of several factors that induce these changes in WLM. For this, several additives, forming binary mixtures with water, were studied, through rheology of CTAB/NaSal and calorimetry of tetradecyltrimethylammonium bromide (TTAB)/NaSal. Experiments Herein, we present the zero-shear viscosity diagrams of NaSal and CTAB with glycerol, sucrose, dimethyl sulfoxide, 1,3-butanediol and urea combined with water. Additionally, isothermal titration calorimetry was used to obtain the variations of enthalpy for formation of WLM of TTAB and NaSal in mixtures of water and such additives. Findings Based on our data, only the refractive index match is not enough to explain the rheological and calorimetric behaviors of the WLM. For instance, sucrose has little effect on the micelles, even at the same refractive index match conditions. Additional characteristics, such as dielectric constant, the cohesivity of the solvent (here symbolized by the Gordon parameter), and the interactions of the additive with the micelles, have to be considered to better describe the results.},

 abstract = {Molecular dynamics simulations and infrared spectroscopy were used to determine the hydrogen bond patterns of glycerol and its mixtures with water. The ability of glycerol/water mixtures to inhibit ice crystallization is linked to the concentration of glycerol and the hydrogen bonding patterns formed by these solutions. At low glycerol concentrations, sufficient amounts of bulk-like water exist, and at low temperature, these solutions demonstrate crystallization. As the glycerol concentration is increased, the bulk-like water pool is eventually depleted. Water in the first hydration shell becomes concentrated around the polar groups of glycerol, and the alkyl groups of glycerol self-associate. Glycerol-glycerol hydrogen bonds become the dominant interaction in the first hydration shell, and the percolation nature of the water network is disturbed. At glycerol concentrations beyond this point, glycerol/water mixtures remain glassy at low temperatures and the glycerol-water hydrogen bond favors a more linear arrangement. High glycerol concentration mixtures mimic the strong hydrogen bonding pattern seen in ice, yet crystallization does not occur. Hydrogen bond patterns are discussed in terms of hydrogen bond angle distributions and average hydrogen bond number. Shift in infrared frequency of related stretch and bend modes is also reviewed.},

 abstract = {Unilamellar vesicles are observed to form in aqueous solutions of the cationic surfactant, cetyl trimethylammonium bromide (CTAB), when 5-methyl salicylic acid (5mS) is added at slightly larger than equimolar concentrations. When these vesicles are heated above a critical temperature, they transform into long, flexible wormlike micelles. In this process, the solutions switch from low-viscosity, Newtonian fluids to viscoelastic, shear-thinning fluids having much larger zero-shear viscosities (e.g., 1000-fold higher). The onset temperature for this transition increases with the concentration of 5mS at a fixed CTAB content. Small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) measurements show that the phase transition from vesicles to micelles is a continuous one, with the vesicles and micelles coexisting over a narrow range of temperatures. The tunable vesicle-to-micelle transition and the concomitant viscosity increase upon heating may have utility in a range of areas, including microfluidics, controlled release, and tertiary oil recovery.},

The topological requirement that P cannot intersect any of the chains of G is taken into account by a rigorous procedure: The only motions allowed for the chain are associated with the displacement of certain ``defects'' along the chain. The main conclusions derived from this model are the following:(a) There are two characteristic times for the chain motion: One of them (Td) is the equilibration time for the defect concentration, and is proportional to M2. The other time (Tr) is the time required for complete renewal of the chain conformation, and is proportional to M3.(b) The over-all mobility and diffusion coefficients of the chain P are proportional to M$-$2.(c) At times t {\textless } Tr the mean square displacement of one monomer of P increases only like (rt $-$ r0)2 = const t1/4.These results may also turn out to be useful for the (more difficult) problem of entangle...},

The urea-induced effects investigated are increases in amphiphile critical micelle concentrations, ionization degrees (alpha), and aggregation numbers; decreases in percolation thresholds of reversed micelles; expansion of minimum areas of monolayers; increases in the radii of gyration of polyelectrolytes; changes in morphologies of sodium bis-2-ethylhexylsulfosuccinate thin films on glass substrates; and direct evidence for urea-induced reduction in ion pairing. All of these effects are attributed to an urea-induced enhancement of the hydrophilic properties of water that results in more strongly solvated polar groups and ions and a. reduction in ion pair formation. The implications of this analysis for urea effects on protein 3-D structure are briefly highlighted.},

 abstract = {Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) have been shown in animal and human systems to be effective natural antibiotics. However, it is unclear how they convey protection; they often appear inactive when assayed under culture conditions applied to synthetic antibiotics. This inactivation has been associated with loss of function in physiological concentrations of NaCl or serum. In this study we show that the balance of host ionic conditions dictate microbial sensitivity to AMPs. Carbonate is identified as the critical ionic factor present in mammalian tissues that imparts the ability of AMPs such as cathelicidins and defensins to kill at physiological NaCl concentrations. After adapting to carbonate-containing solutions, global changes occur in Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli structure and gene expression despite no change in growth rate. Our findings show that changes in cell wall thickness and Sigma factor B expression correspond to the increased susceptibility to the AMP LL-37. These observations provide new insight into the factors involved in enabling function of innate immune effector molecules, and suggest that discovery of new antimicrobials should specifically target pathogens as they exist in the host and not the distinctly different phenotype of bacteria grown in culture broth.},

In this review, we present a classification of wormlike micelles, with a focus on novel systems and applications. We describe the current state of understanding of their linear rheology and give a detailed account of recent progress in small-angle neutron scattering, a particularly powerful technique to elucidate their microstructure on a wide range of length-scales.},

 abstract = {This tutorial review deals with one of the most remarkable forms of surfactant aggregates, described as having a flexible, elongated cylindrical shape. Three structural scale lengths are pertinent to the flexibility and mobility of worm micelles: the cross-sectional radius, rcs, the overall (contour) length, L, and the persistence length, lp. The diversity of lpvalues in amphiphilic systems is demonstrated as well as the relation between L and lp. The review also discusses the viscoelasticity of worm micelles and the relaxation mechanisms underlying this dominant property. Many aspects of viscoelasticity - such as non-linearity, shear banding, flow-induced phase transition, rheochaos - are only shortly described. The prevailing application of worm micelles, namely as fracture fluids and drag reducing agents are discussed in detail, stressing the effect of variations in the surfactant molecular structure on the efficacy of worm micelles. The vague possibility of using "smart" worm micelles in the foreseeable future is tersely outlined. {\copyright } 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

 abstract = {Phase behavior of didodecyl and dioctadecydimethylammonium bromide (DDAB and DODAB) in water was studied using X-ray techniques, differential scanning calorimetry and deuterium nuclear magnetic resonance measurements. Both surfactants self-assemble into lamellar liquid crystalline, either L $\alpha$ (fluid) and L $\beta$ (gel), phases. The gel-to-fluid phase transition temperature (T m) in DDAB lamellae was found to be higher than that observed for its vesicles, due to the formation of a stabilized gel phase. In addition, the lamellar phases formed by both amphiphiles differ in their swelling degree and bilayer thickness. DODAB in water formed rather thin bilayers, if compared with the length of the tails, suggesting effective chain interdigitation. These bilayers also presented higher swelling degree than those formed by the shorter-chain homologue DDAB. We propose that these structural properties are strongly influenced by the electrostatic repulsive forces acting on the system.},

 abstract = {The apparent and partial molar enthalpies, apparent molar volumes, and adiabatic compressibilities at 298 K of the aqueous solutions of the cationic gemini surfactants propanediyl-alpha,omega-bis(octyldimethylammonium bromide) (8-3-8) and propanediyl-alpha,omega-bis(dodecyldimethylammonium bromide) (12-3-12) have been measured as a function of concentration. The trends of the partial molar enthalpies versus concentration are the first well documented thermodynamic evidence of sphere to rod transition in the micellar phase, involving a detectable quantity of heat, and allow the determination of the change in enthalpy associated with this transition. The changes in enthalpies upon micellization and for the sphere to elongated micelles transition, DeltaH(s)(--{\textgreater })(r), have been obtained from the experimental data by using a pseudo-phase transition approach: -1.5 kJ mol(-1) for 8-3-8 and -3.9 kJ mol(-1) for 12-3-12. No evidence of the above transition is found in the trends of volumetric properties versus m. The apparent adiabatic molar compressibilities for the compounds under investigation are also reported here for the first time: a negative group contribution for the methylene group is evaluated, when the surfactants are present in solution as a single molecule, reflecting its solvation structure. In the micellar phase, the -CH(2)- group contribution becomes positive. A value of 1.17 x 10(-3) cm(3) bar(-1) mol(-1) for the change in adiabatic molar compressibility upon micellization is obtained. The lower values of the methylene group contributions to the volumetric properties for the monomers support the hypothesis of partial association of the chains before the cmc.},

 abstract = {The ideas of the first and second papers in this series, which make it possible to interpret entropy data in terms of a physical picture, are applied to binary solutions, and equations are derived relating energy and volume changes when a solution is formed to the entropy change for the process. These equations are tested against data obtained by various authors on mixtures of normal liquids, and on solutions of non-polar gases in normal solvents. Good general agreement is found, and it is concluded that in such solutions the physical picture of molecules moving in a "normal'' manner in each others' force fields is adequate. As would be expected, permanent gases, when dissolved in normal liquids, loosen the forces on neighboring solvent molecules producing a solvent reaction which increases the partial molal entropy of the solute. Entropies of vaporization from aqueous solutions diverge strikingly from the normal behavior established for non-aqueous solutions. The nature of the deviations found for non-polar solutes in water, together with the large effect of temperature upon them, leads to the idea that the water forms frozen patches or microscopic icebergs around such solute molecules, the extent of the iceberg increasing with the size of the solute molecule. Such icebergs are apparently formed also about the non-polar parts of the molecules of polar substances such as alcohols and amines dissolved in water, in agreement with Butler's observation that the increasing insolubility of large non-polar molecules is an entropy effect. The entropies of hydration of ions are discussed from the same point of view, and the conclusion is reached that ions, to an extent which depends on their sizes and charges, may cause a breaking down of water structure as well as a freezing or saturation of the water nearest them. Various phenomena recorded in the literature are interpreted in these terms. The influence of temperature on certain salting out coefficients is interpreted in terms of entropy changes. It appears that the salting out phenomenon is at least partly a structural effect. It is suggested that structural influences modify the distribution of ions in an electrolyte solution, and reasons are given for postulating the existence of a super lattice structure in solutions of LaCl3 and of EuCl3. An example is given of a possible additional influence of structural factors upon reacting tendencies in aqueous solutions.},

The surfactant concentrations correspond to dilute and semidilute solutions for the wormlike micelles. The analysis of the forward scattering demonstrates a concentration dependence of the growth of the micelles in agreement with mean-field theory. The scattering data in the full range of measured scattering vectors were analyzed using a modified random phase approximation expression, and excellent agreement was found for concentrations up to 65 times the overlap concentration. The model fitting showed that the micelles have an elliptical cross section with semiaxes of about 16 and 28 Angstrom. Based on the self-consistent analysis, an independent comparison between the correlation length determined from the scattering data and from Monte Carlo simulations was performed as a function of the reduced concentration.},

 abstract = {Aqueous solutions of fully ionized tetradecyldimethylamine oxide (TDAO) with addition of 0.1 M NaCl were investigated by small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) and static light scattering (SLS). The analysis of the data showed that the surfactant under these conditions forms short stiff cylindrical micelles. The surfactant concentration ranges from 2 times the critical micelle concentration to well above the overlap concentration of the cylindrical micelles. A self-consistent approach was used for analyzing the SANS and SLS data simultaneously. The forward scattering was determined from the scattering at low scattering vectors, and from this, the apparent molar mass of the micelles was derived. It was fitted by a model with a power-law growth law combined with a term which describes intermicellar interaction effects. The length of the micelles was derived from the growth law using the mass per unit length as determined from the scattering data at high scattering vectors. Finally, the data in the full range of measured scattering vectors were fitted for all concentrations by a model based on the polymer reference interaction site model with a simple ansatz for the direct correlation function. The variations of the parameters of the micelles as obtained in the analysis were compared to the parameters for solutions of half-ionized TDAO for which semiflexible micelles are formed.},

 abstract = {Hypothesis: The relaxation time in viscoelastic surfactant solutions is a function of temperature, salt/surfactant concentrations, resting conditions, as well as shear frequency. The simplistic assumption of a single and constant relaxation time is not representative of all relaxation modes in these solutions especially at high frequencies. Experiments: Steady-state and oscillatory measurements are carried out to study the effects of high temperature, concentration and resting condition on the rheology of surfactants/salt mixtures including a non-ionic and a zwitterionic/anionic surfactant system. Furthermore, a novel semi-empirical rheological model is deducted based on Cates theory. This model introduces, for the first time, a frequency-dependence for the continuous relaxation time spectrum. Findings: At high temperatures, the non-ionic surfactant become more viscoelastic and the zwitterionic/anionic system loses its viscoelasticity. The addition of surfactant/salt improves the viscoelasticity of both systems, and, for the zwitterionic/anionic mixture, increasing the resting temperature improves its viscoelasticity. In addition, the proposed model significantly improves predictions of traditional Maxwell model for different viscoelastic surfactant solutions (using data from this study and the literature) for a considerable range of surfactant and salt combinations at a wide range of temperature.},

Forced to respond quickly, it bounces like rubber. We can trace this ``viscoelastic'' behavior, which shows up in all polymer melts, to the knotting of the chains of ``monomers'' that make up the polymers. Shearing forces tend to undo certain knots, but this takes a finite time $\tau$. In a time greater than $\tau$ the original knots fade out, and the melt flows. Over shorter times the original knots are all present, and the melt behaves like an elastic network. A theory based on the snake-like motion by which chains of monomers move in the melt is enhancing our understanding of rheology, diffusion, polymer--polymer welding, chemical kinetics and biotechnology.},

 abstract = {The synergistic growth of giant wormlike micelles in ternary mixed solutions composed of an anionic surfactant (sodium laurylethersulfate, SLES), a zwitterionic surfactant (cocamidopropyl betaine, CAPB), and octanoic acid (HC8) is studied. Rheological data and their analysis in terms of Cole--Cole plots and micellar characteristic times are presented, and the micellar structures behind the observed rheological behavior are revealed by cryo-TEM micrographs. The surfactant composition is fixed near the maximal micelle size of the binary SLES + CAPB system, whereas the concentration of HC8 is varied. At a given HC8 concentration, the viscosity of the ternary micellar solutions exhibits a very high and sharp peak. Polarized-light optical microscopy indicates that all investigated solutions are isotropic rather than liquid-crystalline. The cryo-TEM imaging shows complex phase behavior: wormlike micelles to the left of the peak, giant entangled wormlike micelles at the peak, and long wormlike micelles coexisting with multiconnected micellar aggregates to the right of the peak. The formation of multiconnected micelles leads to a drop in viscosity at the higher concentrations. The results contribute to a better understanding of the structure--rheology relations in micellar surfactant solutions and could be useful for controlling the properties of formulations in personal-care and house-hold detergency.},

The purpose of the present work was to investigate the spectroscopic response in the range 1100-2400 nm of solutions of glucose, fructose, and sucrose at concentrations 5-65{\%}. Data indicate that by increasing sugar concentration the water band becomes more symmetric and there is a shift of the absorption maximum toward longer wavelengths. Spectra were interpreted in terms of "structure- maker" and "structure-breaker" effects of increasing sugar concentration. Sugars at low concentrations behave as structure breaker of the water cluster, while at higher concentrations they act as structure makers. These results could be of some interest when monitoring by NIR processes as freezing, freeze-drying, drying, cryoconcentration, etc. of fruits and vegetables, where the removal or separation of large amounts of water induce the formation of very concentrated sugars solutions. {\copyright } 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

 abstract = {It is shown that phospholipid dispersions with a few percent of diacylphosphocholine PC in water can be swollen to single-phase lyotropic liquid crystalline L$\alpha$-phases by the addition of co-solvents like glycerol, 1,3-butyleneglycol BG or 1,2-propyleneglycol PG. The birefringent L$\alpha$-phases contain small unilamellar and multilamellar vesicles if the temperature of the samples is above the Krafft-Temperature Tmof the phospholipid. When such transparent birefringent viscous samples are cooled down below Tmthe samples are transformed into birefringent gels. Cryo-TEM and FF-TEM measurements show that the bilayers of the vesicles are transformed from the liquid to the crystalline state during the transformation while the vesicle structure remains. The bilayers of the crystalline vesicles form adhesive contacts in the gel. Pulsed-field gradient NMR measurements show that two different kinds of water or co-solvent can be distinguished in the gels. One type of solvent molecules can diffuse like normal solvent in a continuous bulk phase. A second type of water diffuses much more slowly. This type of solvent is obviously trapped in the vesicles. The permeability of the crystalline vesicles for water and solvent molecules is much lower in the crystalline state than in the fluid state. Maximum swelling of the diacylphosphocholin dispersions occurs when the refractive index of the solvent is matched to the refractive index of the bilayers. The attraction between the bilayers is at a minimum in this state and the liquid crystalline L$\alpha$-phase's undulation forces between the bilayers push the bilayers apart. On transformation to the gel state the crystalline bilayers assume a high elastic bending rigidity. Undulations of the bilayers are now suppressed, and the bilayers can form adhesive contacts. Oscillating rheological measurements show that the gels with only 1{\%} of phospholipids can have a storage modulus of 1000 Pa. The gels are very brittle. They break when they are deformed by a few percent. {\copyright } 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

 abstract = {The problem of stress relaxation in entangled, reversibly breakable polymers (e.g., wormlike micelles) is considered. In the case where the dominant diffusive mode for the polymers is reptation, this problem has been treated in earlier numerical work by coupling the full reaction kinetics of scissions and recombinations to the dynamics of reptation (represented by a one-dimensional stochastic process). Here we study a simplified renewal model, which replaces the exact reaction kinetics by a Poisson jump process that neglects temporal correlations in the chain length experienced by a particular monomer or tube segment. Between jumps in chain length, the stress relaxation is presumed to follow that of an equivalent unbreakable chain. We apply the solution to the case of reptating flexible polymers and compare the resulting complex modulus with the earlier numerical treatments. It is found that agreement is very good. The renewal model is then used to analyze in detail, for the first time, the crossover to a rapid-scission regime in which chain diffusion between scission events is dominated by breathing modes. A third regime, in which the motion between scission events is Rouse-like, remains unsuitable for study with this model, for reasons that we explain. Various implications of the renewal model for the interpretation of experimental results are discussed. We also provide explicit estimates for chain lengths in CTAC/NaSal/NaCl systems using experimental Cole--Cole plots.},

The critical micelle concentration and the concentration necessary for the onset of viscoelasticity have been determined at 25.0 and 40.0$^\circ$C. It is not possible yet to reach conclusions about the size and shape of the aggregates in the viscoelastic solutions. However these aggregates must differ fundamentally from ordinary micelles (spherical or rodlike). The molecular structure of the counterion is of great importance as salicylate, m-chlorobenzoate, and p-chlorobenzoate give rise to viscoelasticity, whereas o-chlorobenzoate, m-hydroxybenzoate, and p-hydroxybenzoate do note change the micellar structure. {\copyright } 1976.},

To obtain general information concerning their order of magnitude the London-v. d. Waals interaction between two spherical particles is computed as a function of the diameters and the distance separating them. A table is calculated which enables numerical application of the formulae derived. Besides approximations are added, which may be used when the distance between the particles is small. In a separate section it is investigated how the results must be modified, when both particles are immersed in a liquid. Here we are led to the important conclusion that even in that case London-v. d. Waals forces generally cause an attraction. {\copyright } 1937.},

 abstract = {We present a systematic study of the self-assembly of wormlike micelles (WLMs) comprised of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) and sodium nitrate (NaNO3) in aqueous solution as a function of CTAB concentration, NaNO3 concentration, and temperature throughout the dilute and semi-dilute regions of the phase diagram where linear micelles are observed. Combining measurements using isothermal titration calorimetry, rheometry, flow-birefringence, cryo-transmission electron microscopy (cryo-TEM), and small angle neutron scattering (SANS) enables complete characterization of the structure, thermodynamics, and rheology of CTAB/NaNO3 micelles. The addition of NaNO3 is found to increase the micellization enthalpy as well as the micellar scission energy, resulting in the elongation and growth of WLMs. We find quantitative agreement between the scission energy determined from rheology and the enthalpy of micellization determined from ITC, as well as for contour lengths extracted from rheology and SANS. At fixed molar ratio of NaNO3 and CTAB, the solution rheology exhibits scaling consistent with dilute, semi-dilute overlapping, and semi-dilute entangled regimes typically found in polymer solutions, as confirmed by cryo-TEM and SANS. The transition between these scaling regimes coincides with the structural transitions identified by SANS. The results validate the relationship between structural parameters and rheological behavior underlying theories for ionic WLMs. {\copyright } 2010.},

 abstract = {The influence of excess NaCl on the properties of viscoelastic detergent solutions of Cetypyridiniumsalicylate (CPySal) has been studied by static and dynamic light scattering, electric birefringence and rheological measurements. It is obeserved that the rodlike micelles of length L which are present in these solutions and which are responsible for their elastic properties grow in length with the increase of the NaCl concentration. As long as the rods are shorter than their mean distance, their length can be determined from the rheological and electric birefringence measurements. For very small shear fields these solutions behave as Newtonian fluids. The viscosity of the solution increases strongly when the rods begin to overlap. Solutions with overlapping rods are elastic. It is postulated from the results that the cmcII(the critical concentration above which rods are present) and the length L of the rods are partially determined by the intermicellar interaction energy. It is furthermore postulated that this intermicellar interaction energy has an influence on the polydispersity of the rods and seems to make the rods relatively monodisperse. {\copyright } 1982.},

 abstract = {In this article we shall describe processes and phenomena which may appear startling and unusual for someone who is familiar with the behavior of solutions of low molecular weight solutes. Some of these phenomena might even be surprising for someone who works with surfactants. The authors still remember their astonishment when they first became aware of a viscoelastic surfactant solution. This was many years after our group had started investigations on surfactants. But all of the solutions we had encountered until that time had behaved normally. Some of the phenomena which will be discussed are also encountered in solutions of polymers. Due to their high molecular weight one expects to find properties which are different from the properties of low molecular weight solutions and does not find them so surprising. Surfactant solutions, however, are aqueous solutions of small molecules with typical molecular weights of 200 to 400. For some of our experiments even dilute solutions were used which contained only up to one percent of surfactant.},

 abstract = {Aqueous solutions of surfactant systems containing rodlike micelles were examined by the transient and dynamic electric birefringence method. It is demonstrated that all surfactant solutions with charged anisometric micelles show an anomalous behavior in the electric field. The results were obtained on solutions of hexadecyloctyldimethylammonium bromide and on mixtures of tetradecyldimethylamine oxide and sodium dodecyl sulfate. In the dilute concentration range of both systems a normal birefringence is observed with a single relaxation time T{\~{}}, which is due to a rotational motion of the micelles. Beginning at the overlap concentration of the rods, a second effect with an opposite sign of the birefringence becomes apparent. The relaxation time 72 of this effect is a factor 10-30 longer than T{\~{}}. At even higher concentrations a third effect 73 with the same sign as the first one begins to appear. The amplitude of this effect increases rapidly with concentration and finally dominates the birefringence signal. The second effect is explained as a coupled rotational translational motion that is caused by an additional electric field of the electrically polarized surrounding micelles. During this process the rod axes are aligned perpendicular to the electric field. The third effect is due to a cooperative process of correlated micelles. In some cases a forth relaxation time T{\~{}} can be observed, which seems to be due to a deformation and relaxation of a temporary network, which is built from the rods. The anomalous behavior is explained on the basis of intermicellar electrostatic interactions. The anomaly can be suppressed by addition of salt. Otherwise it is possible to charge a zwitterionic system like tetra- decyldimethylamineoxide with sodium dodecyl sulfate molecules, and as a result the anomaly appears.},

 abstract = {Many proteins are surface active molecules and form stable emulsions. In these emulsions, the protein covered oil droplets behave as sticky droplets even when they are ionically charged. As a result of the stickiness of the droplets the emulsions have gel-like properties. The stickiness is due to the multipolar nature of the proteins in contrast to the bipolar nature of surfactants or other amphiphilic compounds that form emulsions with repulsive droplets. Stable emulsions are also formed from particles like clays to which proteins are adsorbed. These hybrid compounds form even more stable emulsions with stronger elastic properties than clays and proteins on their own. These so called pickering emulsions have paste-like properties and do not flow. The scaffolding network of the crosslinked protein bilayers on the droplets is so strong that both the water and the oil can be removed from the emulsions by freeze drying without collapse of the scaffold. The resulting sponge can be used again for the uptake of both water and oil. Emulsions which are prepared from different proteins differ mainly in their elastic properties. {\copyright } 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

 abstract = {Wormlike micelles formed by the addition to cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) of a range of aromatic cosolutes with small molecular variations in their structure were systematically studied. Phenol and derivatives of benzoate and cinnamate were used, and the resulting mixtures were studied by oscillatory, steady-shear rheology, and the microstructure was probed by small-angle neutron scattering. The lengthening of the micelles and their entanglement result in remarkable viscoelastic properties, making rheology a useful tool to assess the effect of structural variations of the cosolutes on wormlike micelle formation. For a fixed concentration of CTAB and cosolute (200 mmol L(-1)), the relaxation time decreases in the following order: phenol {\textgreater } cinnamate{\textgreater } o-hydroxycinnamate {\textgreater } salicylate {\textgreater } o-methoxycinnamate {\textgreater } benzoate {\textgreater } o-methoxybenzoate. The variations in viscoelastic response are rationalized by using Mulliken population analysis to map out the electronic density of the cosolutes and quantify the barrier to rotation of specific groups on the aromatics. We find that the ability of the group attached to the aromatic ring to rotate is crucial in determining the packing of the cosolute at the micellar interface and thus critically impacts the micellar growth and, in turn, the rheological response. These results enable us for the first time to propose design rules for the self-assembly of the surfactants and cosolutes resulting in the formation of wormlike micelles with the cationic surfactant CTAB.},

 abstract = {{\copyright } 2015 American Chemical Society. Although wormlike micelles (WLM) were first described more than 30 years ago, many aspects of their formation process are still unclear. Herein, a systematic experimental investigation of the process for wormlike micelle (WLM) formation in mixtures of tetradecyltrimethylammonium bromide (C {\textless } inf {\textgreater } 14 {\textless } /inf {\textgreater } TAB) and salicylate (2-hydroxybenzoate) was carried out. This system was used as a model to investigate the conditions for the formation of the giant aggregate. For comparison, the other two isomers of salicylate (3- and 4-hydroxybenzoate) were also investigated, once in these cases wormlike micelles are not formed. The studies were based on calorimetric titration, static light scattering, and rheological measurements. Enthalpy changes upon titration of C {\textless } inf {\textgreater } 14 {\textless } /inf {\textgreater } TAB into 2-hydroxybenzoate solutions revealed a highly cooperative and exothermic process that was associated with micelle growth. The size of the aggregates, obtained by static light scattering measurements, confirms the shape transition. In addition, the correlation of these two sets of results with measurements of micelle charge surface indicates that this transition occurs around the point of charge neutralization.},

Three groups of aromatic molecules were investigated: neutral (phenol), benzoate derivatives and cinnamate derivatives. In addition, the thermal stabilities of the WLMs (of hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide, C16TAB) and the aromatic co-solutes of the three groups were investigated by measuring the temperatures at which the WLMs break and lose their ability to produce hydrodynamic drag reduction. A comparison of the results was used to establish correlations between the spontaneity of WLMs formation, their thermal stability and the molecular structure of the aromatic co-solutes. A characteristic thermal pattern with four steps was observed when WLMs are formed, that depended on the co-solute structure. Micellar growth was found to be an exothermic process, related to the fusion of the end caps allied with the incorporation of more co-solutes. The co-solutes that had negative charge and were able to maintain planar configuration demonstrated stronger interactions and also showed higher thermal stability through drag reduction.},

This is mainly as a result of the lack of sufficiently fast methods that can capture the structural changes of such transitions. Herein, a simple surfactant system consisting of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) in aqueous NaCl solutions is investigated. Combining synchrotron radiation small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) with fast stopped-flow mixing schemes allows monitoring the process where polymer-like micelles are formed from globular micelles when the salt concentration is suddenly increased.

Here, this approach is used to study the formation of cylindrical micelles after mixing two solutions with globular micelles of the nonionic surfactant dodecyl maltoside (DDM) and the anionic surfactant sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), respectively. Two separate processes were identified: (i) a transition in micellar shell structure, interpreted as exchange of surfactant molecules resulting in mixed globular micelle...},

 abstract = {We studied the effect of a trace amount of perfumes and oils on the rheological properties of micellar solutions formed in a water/sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)/tri(oxyethylene) dodecyl ether (C12EO3) system which gives a maximum zero-shear viscosity as a function of surfactant mixing fraction due to wormlike micelle formation. By adding high-polarity perfumes and oils (9-decen-1-ol, 1-decanol, l-menthol, geraniol and $\alpha$-terpineol), the viscosity peak shifts to lower hydrophobic surfactant composition and the degree of the viscosity peak shift is the largest for the linear-chain molecules and smaller for the branched or cyclic molecules. Dynamic frequency tests show that the zero-shear viscosity behavior for different high-polarity perfume and oil systems varies due to the change in the relaxation time behavior. The linear-chain molecules can penetrate well in the palisade layer of micelles and the penetration could be interrupted by branched or cyclic molecular architecture. On the other hand, by adding low-polarity perfumes and oils (p-cymene, hexahydrocumene, butylbenzene, d-limonene and decane), the behavior of the viscosity curve is quite different for decane and for other molecules, i.e. decane decreases the viscosity peak without shift of surfactant mixing fraction whereas other molecules behave as high-polarity molecules. {\copyright } 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

When CS2 was used as a charge-exchange gas, its pressure was varied in the range 0.05-0.4 torr. The apparatus used for low-pressure ion-molecule reaction studies was a home-built FTMSN controlled by a Nicolet FTMS-1000 data system. The cell was located in a magnetic field of 1.2 T. The trapping voltage was to 1 V. The ions were formed by an electron beam biased at 9-15 eV and pulsed for 5 ms. The ions were excited by a 800-kHz excitation bandwidth "chirp" and measured by acquiring the mass spectrum over the mass range 20-150 amu at variable time delays ranging from 1 to 700 ms.

Abstract: In order to study the effect of urea on water structure, a molecular dynamics simulation of a dilute aqueous urea solution has been carried out. A rigid body model is used to represent urea, and the intermolecular potentials are given by Lennard-Jones and electrostatic terms. Only very small differences are observed between the properties of water molecules in the solvation region of urea and the bulk, and these differences can be assigned to direct urea-water interactions, with no substantial perturbation of water-water interactions. Implications for the mechanism of solubilization of hydrocarbons by urea are discussed.},

The presence of urea in the solvation region of the apolar sphere is found to weaken the water-water interactions in this region, although they are still stronger than in the bulk solvent. Urea-water interactions are enhanced in the solvation region as compared to aqueous urea. The implications of the results for the experimentally known improved solvation of apolar molecules in aqueous urea are discussed.

 abstract = {The effect of an organic counterion, p-toluenesulfonate (p-TS$-$) and a Hofmeister series of inorganic counterions, NO3$-$, Br$-$and SO42--on the solvation dynamics and rotational relaxation of Coumarin 480 (C-480) in the Stern layer of aqueous micelles of hexadecyltrimethylammonium surfactants (C16TAX) has been studied. Studies have been carried out by means of UV--vis absorption, steady-state fluorescence and fluorescence anisotropy, time-resolved fluorescence and fluorescence anisotropy, and dynamic light scattering measurements. The rate of solvation increases in the order C16TABr {\textless } C16TANO3 {\textless } (C16TA)2SO4 {\textless } C16TAp-TS. Effectively, the solvation process is controlled by the extent of release of water molecules during the formation of micelles which depends on the nature of counterion. p-TS$-$counterions are more tightly bound to the headgroups because of added effect of its hydrophobic part. Counterions indirectly contribute to the slow solvation by the formation of clusters of water molecules. The decreasing order of the average rotational relaxation time of C-480 in the micelles of surfactants is C16TAp-TS {\textgreater }{\textgreater } C16TABr {\textgreater } C16TANO3 {\textgreater } (C16TA)2SO4, which is the same as the decreasing order of microviscosity of micelles. The rotational relaxation time is shorter in the micelles of (C16TA)2SO4as compared to C16TAp-TS as the former micelles have less tightly packed structure than the latter. The slow rotational relaxation is mainly contributed by the lateral diffusion of C-480 along the surface of the micelle. The rotational motion is the slowest for the micelle of (C16TA)2SO4, and the same is the fastest for the micelle of C16TABr. There is an indication of different orientation of C-480 molecules in viscous micelles of C16TAp-TS as compared to other less viscous micelles. The fact of counterion dependent solvation processes might help us for various studies on physicochemical properties of surfactants in solutions.},

 abstract = {Rheological properties of aqueous solutions of long-tailed cationic surfactant erucyl bis-(hydroxyethyl)methylammonium chloride (EHAC) were examined as a function of concentration C-s of different inorganic salts (KCl, CaCl2, and LaCl3) at a fixed surfactant concentration of 0.6 wt {\%}. The structural evolution of micelles was followed by small angle neutron scattering and cryogenic transmission electron microscopy. It was observed that, upon addition of salt, the zero-shear viscosity eta(0) of semidilute surfactant solutions goes through a maximum by passing the following three regimes: eta(0) similar to C-s(10) (regime I), eta(0) similar to C-s(3.5) (regime II), and eta(0) similar to C-s(-2) (regime III). In regime I, the micelles grow in length; in regime II, the linear growth of micelles proceeds simultaneously with their branching; and in regime III, the branching becomes dominating. With increase in the salt valence, the viscosity curves shift to a lower salt content, indicating that these salts are more effective in inducing micellar elongation and branching, as they contain a larger amount of anionic species Cl- screening the repulsion between cationic surfactant heads. Diverse roles of salt co- and counterions (i.e., salt ions that are similar and oppositely charged with respect to surfactant head groups) at different salt concentrations were demonstrated. It was shown that at low salt concentrations corresponding to the rising branch of the viscosity curve (regimes I and II), salt counterions (Cl-) fully determine the rheological behavior of the system. At high salt concentrations, when the electrostatic repulsions between micelles and salt co-ions are essentially screened, the co-ions start affecting the rheological properties. Under these conditions, monovalent co-ions (K+) provide much lower viscosity of surfactant solutions than the multivalent ones (Ca2+, La3+), which is consistent with theoretical predictions that suggest the penetration of K+ inside the micellar corona increasing the charge of the micelles and therefore hindering their growth.},

In the temperature and range studied, the aqueous solutions made with CTA2FB do not exhibit shear thickening because 2FB is more kosmotropic than the 3FB and 4FB counterions, and larger shear rates than the ones covered here are needed to observed shear thickening in the CTA2FB system. CTA3FB and CTA4FB aqueous solutions undergo the shear thickening transition due to the formation of shear induced structures (SIS) in the shear range studied. The shear thickening transition in CTA3FB micellar solutions is stronger and appears at lower shear rates than that detected in CTA4FB ones; in addition, the intensity of shear thickening in both systems augments as the parallel-plates gap is increased. These discrepancies detected between the three surfactants studied are related to the differences among the counterion hydrophobicity i.e., 3FB-{\textgreater }4FB-{\textgreater }2FB-.

 abstract = {Specific ion effects in surfactant solutions affect the properties of micelles. Dodecyltrimethylammonium chloride (DTAC), bromide (DTAB), and methanesulfonate (DTAMs) micelles are typically spherical, but some organic anions can induce shape or phase transitions in DTA(+) micelles. Above a defined concentration, sodium triflate (NaTf) induces a phase separation in dodecyltrimethylammonium triflate (DTATf) micelles, a phenomenon rarely observed in cationic micelles. This unexpected behavior of the DTATf/NaTf system suggests that DTATf aggregates have unusual properties. The structural properties of DTATf micelles were analyzed by time-resolved fluorescence quenching, small-angle X-ray scattering, nuclear magnetic resonance, and electron paramagnetic resonance and compared with those of DTAC, DTAB, and DTAMs micelles. Compared to the other micelle types, the DTATf micelles had a higher average number of monomers per aggregate, an uncommon disk-like shape, smaller interfacial hydration, and restricted monomer chain mobility. Molecular dynamic simulations supported these observations. Even small water-soluble salts can profoundly affect micellar properties; our data demonstrate that the -CF3 group in Tf(-) was directly responsible for the observed shape changes by decreasing interfacial hydration and increasing the degree of order of the surfactant chains in the DTATf micelles.},

The results showed the Ia/Ibof Nile red (the fluorescence intensity ratio of the twisted intramolecular charge transfer band to the planar locally excited band) was a more sensitive index than the Ia(the fluorescence intensity of the twisted intramolecular charge transfer band) to represent the micellar transition. This was attributed to the special molecular structure of Nile red that has a large conjugated ring and the can form hydrogen bond with water molecules at the electron acceptor group. This led to sensitive response of the twisted intramolecular charge transfer state of Nile red to the change of microenvironment. {\copyright } 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

 abstract = {A simple yet novel method, isothermal titration microcalorimetry (ITC), was employed to determine the enthalpy change of salt-induced wormlike micelle formation. The observed changes in molar enthalpy of 1-hexadecyl-3-methylimidazolium bromide (C16mimBr), sodium tosylate (NaTos) and sodium salicylate (NaSal) in aqueous solutions have been measured. The transformation enthalpy change from spherical micelle to wormlike micelle ($\Delta$Htra) has been obtained from the simulation method based on the microcalorimetric data. Then the enthalpy change of wormlike micelle formation ($\Delta$Hw) was obtained using a suitable cycle which was closed by the enthalpy change of micelle formation ($\Delta$Hm) and the transformation enthalpy change ($\Delta$Htra). The value of $\Delta$Hwindicated that the wormlike micelle formation in C16mimBr/NaTos system was exothermic while it was endothermic in C16mimBr/NaSal system. The planar structure of the salicylate anion and the $\pi$-$\pi$ interaction between the salicylate anion and the aromatic headgroup of C16mimBr may attribute to this difference. Moreover, the technique presented here to obtain $\Delta$Hwcould be extended to other salt-induced wormlike micelle systems. {\copyright } 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

 abstract = {Background Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) is a general technique that allows for precise and highly sensitive measurements. These measurements may provide a complete and accurate thermodynamic description of association processes in complex systems such as colloidal mixtures. Scope of the review This review will address uses of ITC for studies of surfactant aggregation to form micelles, with emphasis on the thermodynamic studies of homologous surfactant series. We will also review studies on surfactant association with polymers of different molecular characteristics and with colloidal particles. General significance ITC studies on the association of different homologous series of surfactants provide quantitative information on independent contribution from their apolar hydrocarbon chains and polar headgroups to the different thermodynamic functions associated with micellization (Gibbs energy, enthalpy and entropy). Studies on surfactant association to polymers by ITC provide a comprehensive description of the association process, including examples in which particular features revealed by ITC were elucidated by using ancillary techniques such as light or X-ray scattering measurements. Examples of uses of ITC to follow surfactant association to biomolecules such as proteins or DNA, or nanoparticles are also highlighted. Finally, recent theoretical models that were proposed to analyze ITC data in terms of binding/association processes are discussed. Major conclusions This review stresses the importance of using direct calorimetric measurements to obtain and report accurate thermodynamic data, even in complex systems. These data, whenever possible, should be confirmed and associated with other ancillary techniques that allow elucidation of the nature of the transformations detected by calorimetric results, providing a complete description of the process under scrutiny.

 abstract = {The effects of timolol maleate (TM) as a model drug on the physicochemical properties of a reverse micellar solution (RMS) consisting of lecithin in isopropyl myristate were investigated in this study. Special attention was focused on one-dimensional growing of micelles to giant worm-like associates on addition of water and on a subsequent phase transition to lamellar liquid crystals. Reverse micellar solutions with different water and drug contents were examined with photon correlation spectroscopy (PCS), 31P-NMR and oscillation rheology. Lamellar mesophases arise at higher water contents, characterized with polarization microscopy and small-angle X-ray diffraction (SAXD). It was concluded that timolol maleate interacts with the phosphate group of lecithin. These interactions between TM and lecithin are proposed to cause a branching as well as a truncation of the micellar associates. Since the unloaded micelles were found to be larger than those containing TM at the same water content, the interaction between TM and lecithin obviously hinders the formation of associates such as worm-like micelles or planar lamellae to some extent. Furthermore, the viscosity of the RMS is reduced even at small drug loads, which indicates that TM prevents the formation of a network of entangled worm-like micelles. Finally, the entanglement of the unloaded worm-like micelles was identified as a high viscous sol, which transforms into a low viscous gel on further addition of water. As a hypothesis, this gel state was assumed to be a sponge-like phase.},

The most striking feature of the growth law is the existence of a dilute regime, i), in which the average micelle size varies slowly with concentration. At higher concentrations, regimes ii) and iii) are characterized by more rapid growth than for neutral micelles.

Increasing amounts at the surface of the penetrating counterion of the pair, 2,6-dichlorobenzoate, lowers the 1D bending modulus of the micelles, making them more flexible. Micellar contour lengths exhibit a maximum with increasing amounts of a,2,6-dichlorobenzoate at the micellar surface. This is understood in terms of decreases in the micellar end-cap energies, E-c, at high concentrations of penetrating counterion. By decreasing the effective micellar surface charge density, penetrating counterions also cause decreased contributions from electrostatic repulsion, E-e, which retard micellar growth. At low ionic strengths, this results in more extensive micellar growth upon addition of sodium 2,6-dichlorobenzoate rather than NaCl.},

 abstract = {The viscoelastic behaviour of worm-like micelles in small-amplitude oscillatory, steady simple shear and uniaxial extensional flows are analyzed with a model that couples the Oldroyd-B constitutive equation with a kinetic equation that accounts for the structural changes induced by the flow. In some cases, the constitutive equation predicts a viscoelastic behaviour that is consistent with the Cox-Merz rule. Departures from this rule are also predicted. Experimental data obtained for two worm-like micellar systems indicate that in these solutions, the Cox-Merz rule is not usually followed, in agreement with the predictions of our model. In uniaxial extensional flow, the model predicts a strain hardening in the extensional viscosity at low extensional rates and a strain-thinning at high extensional rates. {\copyright } 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

 abstract = {We present a molecular-level theory for amphiphile packing in linear micelles, focusing on the early stages of micellar elongation, i.e., on small and "intermediate-size" micelles, whose endcaps are not yet molded into a final shape. The internal free energy of a micelle of given size and shape is expressed as an integral over local molecular packing free energies in different regions of the micelle. The free energy per molecule is expressed as a sum of interfacial ("opposing forces") and chain conformational contributions, both depending on the local geometry. The equilibrium shape and energy of the micelle is determined by functional minimization of the total free energy. For amphiphiles exhibiting strong preference for packing in the cylindrical geometry, we show that the early stages of growth involve an energetic barrier, resulting in a "gap" in the micellar size distribution. That is, at low total amphiphile concentrations only small (globular) micelles appear in solution. Their concentration reaches a well-defined saturation value, beyond which, all added amphiphiles are incorporated in long micelles, whose "non-interacting" endcaps are well separated by the cylindrical middle part. This, "second CMC" behavior is demonstrated by numerical calculations of micellar size distributions and average aggregation numbers as a function of the total concentration. The conditions necessary for the appearance of a second CMC are analyzed theoretically, with explicit reference to the underlying molecular packing characteristics. In particular, it is shown that a necessary condition for the appearance of a sharply defined second CMC is that the endcap energies (of at least some) of the small or intermediate-size micelles must be considerably lower than the asymptotic (long micelle) value of this quantity. The diameter of the minimal, spherical micelles, as well as that of the final endcaps, is found to be larger than the diameter of the cylindrical body of the very long micelles. Our results are in good qualitative agreement with recent cryo-TEM imaging studies of micellar shape and growth, as well as with previous (less direct) experiments revealing second CMC behavior.},

With added salt of 0.1 and 1 M KBr, the slow growth is not observed and the entanglement seems to exist right from the lowest concentration used in this study (0.07 wt {\%}). The variation of self diffusion coefficient with concentration in the presence of salt is found to be in accordance with the recent theoretical predictions for the scaling of the diffusion constant with concentration. The modes of micellar diffusion are discussed under the purview of these scaling laws.},

It is also an effective cryoprotectant. Insights into how this molecule modulates membrane structure and function would be invaluable toward regulating the above processes and for developing chemical means for enhancing or hindering the absorption of biologically active molecules, in particular into or via the skin. We show here by means of molecular simulations that DMSO can induce water pores in dipalmitoyl-phosphatidylcholine bilayers and propose this to be a possible pathway for the enhancement of penetration of actives through lipid membranes. DMSO also causes the membrane to become floppier, which would enhance permeability, facilitate membrane fusion, and enable the cell membrane to accommodate osmotic and mechanical stresses during cryopreservation.},

From rheological and X-ray scattering studies as well as from freeze fracture imaging, some general patterns of the phase behavior were observed which are remarkably different from those observed for monomeric surfactants. The sequence of phases observed with increasing surfactant concentration was an isotropic wormlike micellar phase, multilayered structures which are first isotropic and then organized with orientational ordering, and an inverted hexagonal phase. The multilayered phase showed a scattering peak corresponding to a periodicity of 40 Angstrom indicating the presence of stacks of bilayers without a water layer in between. For some of the samples, cryo-TEM showed that wormlike micelles (WLM) evolve into a ribbonlike structure (elongated bilayer). Upon further increase in concentration, the ribbons transform into multilayered structures with a well-defined width.},

The glycerol molecules do not exert a hydrophobic effect on H2O. Rather, the hydroxyl groups of glycerol, perhaps by forming clusters via its alkyl backbone with hydroxyl groups pointing outward, interact with H2O so as to reduce the characteristics of liquid H2O. The global hydrogen bond probability and, hence, the percolation nature of the hydrogen bond network is reduced. In addition, the degree of fluctuation inherent in liquid H2O is reduced by glycerol perhaps by participating in the hydrogen bond network via OH groups. At infinite dilution, the pair interaction coefficients in enthalpy were evaluated and these data suggest a possibility that the interaction is mediated through H2O.},

 abstract = {Copyright {\copyright } 2018 American Chemical Society. Phase behavior of surfactants in water may be affected by addition of a third component, and the present study discusses how long chain n-alcohols affect phase transitions of systems formed by alkyltrimethylammonium surfactants, C 16 TAB, or its complex salts formed with polyacrylate, C 16 TAPA 30 , as well as other previously reported complex salts/water/alcohol systems. X-ray diffraction at small and wide angles was used to characterize structures at different temperatures. Results from differential scanning calorimetry allowed us to study phase transitions and the coexistence of lamellar-gel (L $\beta$ ) and lamellar liquid-crystal (L $\alpha$ ) phases, elucidating the K structure previously observed by Fontell et al. [1]. Whereas the chain-melting transition is known to be sharp for lipids, we found it is broader for C 16 TAB and C 16 TAPA in the presence of n-alcohols. We investigated the effects of their composition and chain length on the temperature and enthalpy of transition. It elucidates why the addition of n-alcohols with chains shorter than the surfactants leads to the formation of L $\beta$ . n-Alcohols act as neutral cosurfactants leading to more packing and all the factors converge to a limit situation, which is a critical area occupied by each alkyl chain. We also demonstrated that the same trends of phase behavior occur for complex salts of other polyelectrolytes with alkyltrimethylammonium surfactants.},

 abstract = {For more than 20 years, the abnormally thick mucus (mucoviscidosis) in cystic fibrosis has been widely shown to be linked to a genetic defect in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator Cl(-) channel. The defect is widely thought to cause mucus to become dehydrated as a result of basic defects in Cl(-) dependent fluid transport. However, this widely held explanation is inconsistent with the known physiological properties and functions of organs affected by cystic fibrosis. During the process of releasing highly condensed mucins from intracellular granules, Ca(2+) and H(+) cations must be removed to enable the mucins to expand by as much as 1000 times, forming extracellular mucus-gel networks. Over the past few years, that HCO(3)(-) transport is also defective in patients with cystic fibrosis has become apparent. I propose that HCO(3)(-) is crucial to normal mucin expansion because it forms complexes with these cations. Thus, because HCO(3)(-) secretion is defective in cystic fibrosis, mucins in organs affected by cystic fibrosis tend to remain aggregated, poorly solubilised, and less transportable. If the hypothesis is valid, pathogenesis in cystic fibrosis could be due as much to defective transport of HCO(3)(-) as to defective Cl(-) transport.},

 abstract = {The molecular constitution of viscoelastic gels is customarily described in terms of networks, which may have a transient or permanent character. Such supermolecular structures are often observed in biological or macromolecular systems, but can even occur in dilute solutions of some detergents. Surfactant molecules in solution, under suitable conditions, assemble reversibly into large aggregates of rod-like geometry. Depending on the ionic strength of the solution, these particles may be completely stiff or semiflexible. At low concentrations, when the lengths of the rods are much smaller than their mean distance of separation, there exists a sol state which is highly sensitive to shear forces. At higher surfactant concentrations, where the lengths of the rod shaped micelles become comparable to their mean distance, one observes gel formation and the solutions exhibit pronounced elastic properties. In analogy to polymer systems, these elongated, rod shaped micelles are strongly entangled; this leads to complicated flow processes. In comparison to solutions of macromolecules, there is, however, one important difference. The anisometric aggregates of sur-face active compounds are in tbermal equilibrium with single monomers. The permanent exchange of surfactant molecules leads to breaking and reformation processes of the rod shaped aggregates. These kinetic processes cause thermal fluctuations, which result in a finite lifetime of the anisometric micelles. In situations where the elongated micelles are breaking within the time scale of observation, the rheological properties are controlled by kinetic processes. It is just under these circumstances, that we obtain very simple scaling laws and linear relations between all rheological quantities. From a theoretical point of view, this corresponds to an ideal case, which is rarely observed in other types of associ-ation colloids. The viscoelastic surfactant solutions can therefore be used as simple model systems for studies of fundamental principles of flow. The basic ideas and concepts have a general, universal character which leads to a deeper insight into dynamic properties and rheological mechanisms.},

 abstract = {Thermodynamics of micelle formation of the cationic surfactant dodecyltrimethylammonium chloride (DTAC) in water and aqueous NaCl solutions were investigated. Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) has been used to study the effect of the added NaCl on the critical micelle concentration, cmc, and enthalpy of micellization, $\Delta$micHo, between 278.15 and 318.15 K. Gibbs free energy, $\Delta$micGo, and entropy, $\Delta$micSo, were deduced by taking into account the counterion binding. From the temperature dependence of $\Delta$micHothe heat capacities of micellization, $\Delta$miccpo, were determined. NaCl shifts cmc strongly towards lower values, indicating the screening of the repulsions of the polar head groups by counterions; but it influences $\Delta$micHoat higher concentrations of salt only. $\Delta$micGois always negative and slightly temperature dependent. The temperature dependence of $\Delta$micSoindicates that the process of micellization is entropically driven. $\Delta$micHodecreases strongly with increasing temperature and passes through zero (endothermic to exothermic processes). The temperature dependence of the critical micelle concentration exhibits a minimum characterized by $\Delta$micHo= 0, where $\Delta$micGois of purely entropic contribution in all solutions. $\Delta$miccpoare strongly negative in all solvents, relating directly to the removal of water accessible non-polar surface of DTAC in the presence of excess counterions also. {\copyright } 2009 Elsevier Inc.

For p-HB, it has been found that the aggregate is only formed by spherical micelles at all p-HB concentrations. On the other side, the situation is more complex for o-HB, where two distinct states of aggregation can be involved, depending on the concentration of o-HB. At high salt concentration, rodlike micelles are formed, whereas at lower concentration spherical aggregates are predominant. The transition from the cylinder to the sphere increases the mobility of the surfactant because the core of the rodlike micelles is more closely packed due to the expulsion of water from the interior of the aggregate. m-HB exhibits an intermediate behavior between these two extreme situations. The effect of the position of hydrophilic substituents on the aromatic ring on the insertion of the hydroxybenzoate anion in the micellar aggregate has been discussed.},

The effect of alkyl chain length on the micellization process in water has been investigated on 1-decyl-3-methylimidazolium ([C10mim]Cl), 1-dodecyl-3-methylimidazolium ([C12mim]Cl), 1- tetradecyl-3-methylimidazolium ([C14mim]Cl) and 1-hexadecyl-3- methylimidazolium ([C16mim]Cl) chlorides, whereas the influence of counter-ion was studied at the micellization of 1-dodecyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride ([C12mim]Cl), bromide ([C12mim]Br), iodide ([C12mim]I), acetate ([C12mim]OAc), methanesulfonate ([C12mim]OMs), toluen sulfonate ([C12mim]OTs), trifluromethane sulfonate ([C12mim]OTf), trifluoro acetate ([C12mim]TFA) and salicylate ([C12mim]Sal) in water. From ITC experimental data, the corresponding standard thermodynamic parameters of micellization (enthalpy, $\Delta$MH0; Gibbs free energy, $\Delta$MG0; entropy, $\Delta$MS0; heat capacity change, $\Delta$Mcp0) were estimated by help of the mass-action model. It was found that SAILs behave mainly like common cationic surfactants, where cmc values are decreasing with the length of the side alkyl chain and exhibit U-shape dependence on temperature. Remarkable influence of counter-ions on cmc and all thermodynamic functions was observed, however the entropy-enthalpy compensation turned out as a matter of fact, arising from the relationship $\Delta$G = $\Delta$H $-$ T$\Delta$S. $\Delta$Mcp0values were further discussed in terms of the removal of solvent accessible surface areas of SAILs and counter-ion from the contact with water after micellization.},

At that time in many technical branches such as in the paint industry,the ``Ford-cup'' was still considered a sufficient tool for foremen in factories to classify paint batches as ``good'' or ``bad''. Orifice viscometers available under the names of Redwood, Sayboldt etc. were priced at some {\$}100 a piece. Rotational viscometers with a rotor speed programmer and a suitable x/t-recorder were sold at prices almost 100 times higher. It must have caused some amusement at management level when laboratories asked for such large amounts of money for a new rotational viscometer while the ``cups'' were cheap, unbreakable and had been sufficient for quality control for such a long time. HAAKE is proud for having contributed with its' rotational viscometers, worldwide seminars on viscometry and the above mentioned booklet to the understanding of viscometry as a small but important segment of physics. The growing interest in viscometry during the last decades has led to an astonishing increase in the numbers of viscometers sold, which in turn have found users worldwide both in scientific research and in industrial applications. The HAAKE management in the Seventies, of course, knew of the work of the famous Prof. Weissenberg, who already proved that most fluids in their response to shear stresses exhibited both viscous flow and elastic deformation as soon as the early Forties. Prof. Weissenberg also developed the ``Rheogoniometer'', which for the first time enabled the measurement of both the corresponding shear stress signal defining viscosity and the normal force signal characterizing elasticity at a given shear rate. This first top-class rheometer was (by todays' standards) bulky and heavy and it was priced at a quarter of a million dollars, which limited it's sale to only a few outstanding research laboratories around the world. It has been said that in some 30 years only a few hundred of these instruments were actually made and this may have contributed to the fact that the manufacturer eventually dropped this product line. We at HAAKE in 1970 did not dare to offer such highly sophisticated rheometers, which were indeed better than Ford-cups but were priced some 2000-times higher. The last 15 years have seen great changes in the field of rheology and rheometry: Universities and technical colleges are now offering courses in rheometry and it's usage in scientific and technical applications in increasing numbers. Thou- Rheology sands of physicists, chemists and engineers have now understood that in rheology, viscosity and elasticity are linked to each other as closely as ``men and women in the human race'': one should not regard one as more important than the other and certainly not completely ignore one factor in favour of the other! Machine tools have improved so much that for instance air bearings with machining tolerances of microns can be regarded as ``normal'' and strain sensors have been developed that divide a 360$^\circ$ revolution into 1000000 increments or even more. This has led to modern rheometers with a measuring sensitivity which allows an insight into rheological responses which people two decades ago could only have dreamt of. All this would still not have led to much if computerization had not become ``everybody's tool'' within the last ten years with computer prices dropping unbelievably and their capabilities increasing at the same time. We cannot promote dynamic tests in quality control departments unless a computer can handle phase shifts of sinusodial waves of strain inputs and resulting stress responses by means of a Fourier analysis. Equally, only computers can evaluate ``creep and recovery tests'' with regression calculations to differentiate between elasticity and viscosity responses as a function of shear history and recovery time. Data evaluation is carried out automatically in a minute or two by people whose mathematical training does not go much beyond simple calculus. 15 years have passed since the first edition of ``Introduction to Practical Viscometry'' appeared and it is time for a fully revised version including chapters which had then been omitted intentionally and those about which we could not have reported because test methods were not yet fully developed. There are very many good books and papers by famous rheologists such as Walters, Ferry, Cheng, Laun, Gleissle etc. which scientifically-minded readers should refer to. Their works are often quite large volumes which are sometimes difficult to read and comprehend for beginners to rheology. It is hoped that this book, in trying to give simple explanations for often complex phenomena and giving advice on ``what to do and what not to do'', can induce readers to gain an insight into a field that is scientifically and technically fascinating and commercially rewarding.},

Solvation dynamics in the worm-like micelle is found to be about 4-times slower than that in ordinary CTAB micelle.

The spectral width ($\Gamma$) of the time resolved emission spectra of DCM in the micellar aggregates is found to be time dependent.

 abstract = {Self-assembled copolymer micelles have been widely explored for numerous applications including cosmetic formulations and detergency, drug delivery, and agriculture. In many of these technologies at least trace amounts of surfactants and detergents are present, yet little is known regarding their effect on the copolymer micelle structure. In this paper we examine the influence of a nonionic micelle-forming surfactant, Triton X-100, on spherical, nonionic polymeric micelles composed of poly(butadiene)-co-poly(polyethylene oxide). Using cryo-TEM we find that relatively small surfactant concentrations (less than 1:1 molar ratio) are sufficient to disrupt the copolymer assemblies, and to yield, via dimerization, mixed polymer-surfactant micelles with characteristic diameters. Saturation of the polymeric micelles is reached with approximately 3 mM surfactant (1:8 mol ratio). Upon saturation, and in high surfactant excess, coexistence of two homogeneous micellar populations is found: saturated polymer-surfactant micelles, and much smaller micelles of pure surfactant. The lack of complete demicellization of the polymeric micelles is explained by packing constraints of the polymer hydrophobic chains by the added surfactant. This behavior is found to be characteristic of polymeric molecules with hydrophobic-to-hydrophilic molecular weight ratio close to, or exceeding, 0.75. We further found that structural transitions in polymer-surfactant mixtures are fast, and the systems reach equilibrium at time scales characteristic to the small molecule, in contrast with the slow equilibration in polymer-polymer mixtures.},

The glycerol can also be replaced by other co-solvents like butylenglycol. Above T m, the PC spontaneously forms L ? phases with multilamellar vesicles that show a strong stationary birefringence. On cooling below T m, the L ? phases jellify to transparent gels. DSC measurements of the gels show that the PC molecules undergo a phase transition into the crystalline state. This transition does not seem to be accompanied by a change of the morphological structure of the liquid L ? phase. The hydrogels also have a stationary birefringence. The vesicles in the gels have been imaged by the CryoTEM method. The hydrogels are already formed with as little as 1{\%} of PC in the mixed solvent.

 abstract = {In a series of experiments, we studied the dynamic properties of aqueous surfactant solutions of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) at conditions after adding different amounts of sodium salicylate (NaSal). The aggregates, present in these solutions, are elongated, wormlike micelles, which tend to form entanglement networks. The viscoelastic, gel-like samples were analyzed by means of static, dynamic, and electrophoretic light scattering techniques. We separately investigated the effects of surfactant concentration and added salt on intermicellar interactions. The electrostatic interactions between the anisometric micelles were analyzed by considering the effective dimensions of the aggregates. We calculated the Debye-Huckel lengths from experimental data of the osmotic second virial coefficient and from the diffusion second virial coefficient. It turned out that the results were in good agreement with theoretically estimated values. We also measured the zeta potential and intensity of scattered light in a large range of different salt concentrations keeping the CTAB concentration constant. We observed an isoelectric point and charge reversal of the threadlike micelles at an excess salicylate concentration of about 100 mM. The observed decrease of the zeta potential points to striking processes of counterion condensation. In these solutions, the salicylate ion acts as a cosurfactant, due to its discrepancy between polar and hydrophobic groups. We also detected a simple linear correlation between the zeta potentials and the Debye screening lengths of the surfactant solutions.},

 abstract = {BACKGROUND Cystic fibrosis (CF) is characterized by a thick, sticky mucus responsible for both airway obstruction and resistance to drug diffusion, reducing the effectiveness of drug delivery to the lung. Studies of drug-mucus interaction may be a crucial step in therapeutic management of CF. In the present research, the effect of a saline solution of sodium bicarbonate (100 mM) on sputum viscosity and the permeation properties of ketoprofen lysinate (Klys) from a previously developed dry powder inhaler were evaluated. METHODS Rheological measurements were performed using an ARES rotational rheometer (Rheometrics, Inc.) with a parallel plate geometry. The gel fraction, separated from the liquid phase of various sputum samples from CF patients was loaded onto the plate. The elastic (G') and the viscous (G") moduli, tan $\delta$ (ratio of G" to G') and $\eta$* (complex viscosity) were evaluated as frequency-dependent parameters. Drug permeation across CF sputum from dry powders was studied by means of Franz-type vertical diffusion cells. The experiments were conducted on untreated sputum and on sputum treated with bicarbonate. RESULTS Rheological studies showed that the elastic modulus (G') was always greater than the viscous modulus (G") and the viscosity decreased with increasing frequency, as for pseudo-plastic fluids. Bicarbonate caused a downward shift of both the elastic and viscous moduli, with a reduction in complex viscosity. As to drug permeation, the untreated sputum slowed down drug dissolution and permeation compared to buffer permeability (control). Permeation studies across CF sputum treated with bicarbonate showed higher Klys dissolution/permeation than untreated sputum. CONCLUSIONS The interesting results confirm the previously reported bicarbonate. effectiveness in CF; this weak base seems to act by decreasing high viscosity of the CF bronchial secretion and, potentially, resulting in better mucus clearance and in fighting pulmonary infections.},

 abstract = {Biological organization may be viewed as consisting of two stages: biosynthesis and assembly. The assembly process is largely under thermodynamic control; that is, as a first approximation it represents a search by each structural molecule for its state of lowest chemical potential. The hydrophobic effect is a unique organizing force, based on repulsion by the solvent instead of attractive forces at the site of organization. It is responsible for assembly of membranes of cells and intracellular compartments, and the absence of strong attractive forces makes the membranes fluid and deformable. The spontaneous folding of proteins, however, involves directed polar bonds, leading to more rigid structures. Intercellular organization probably involves polar bonds between cell surface proteins.},

 abstract = {We report a new route for forming reverse wormlike micelles (i.e., long, flexible micellar chains) in nonpolar organic liquids such as cyclohexane and n-decane. This route involves the addition of a bile salt (e.g., sodium deoxycholate) in trace amounts to solutions of the phospholipid lecithin. Previous recipes for reverse wormlike micelles have usually required the addition of water to induce reverse micellar growth; here, we show that bile salts, due to their unique " facially amphiphilic " structure, can play a role analogous to that of water and promote the longitudinal aggregation of lecithin molecules into reverse micellar chains. The formation of transient entangled networks of these reverse micelles transforms low-viscosity lecithin organosols into strongly viscoelastic fluids. The zero-shear viscosity increases by more than 5 orders of magnitude, and it is the molar ratio of bile salt to lecithin that controls the viscosity enhancement. The growth of reverse wormlike micelles is also confirmed by small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) experiments on these fluids.},

Direct structural studies show a transition from rigid cylindrical micelles at neutral pH to spherical micelles at $\sim$ pH 2 upon protonation of salicylate molecules; however, an unanticipated reversion to flexible cylindrical micelles with further decrease in pH was observed. We also observed these microstructure transitions from cylinders at high pH to spherical micelles at intermediate pH to flexible cylindrical micelles at low pH were highly sensitive to temperature. Our results suggest that, in addition to the well-described electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions in cationic surfactant--hydrotrope mixtures, the pH-induced microstructural changes are potentially governed by complementary cation$-$$\pi $ and hydrogen bond...},

 abstract = {The application of time-resolved fluorescence methods to study the aggregation behavior in aqueous solution of anionic surfactant sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) in presence of trivalent counterions (Al3+) was investigated. Addition of small amounts of aluminum salt to dilute micellar solutions ({\textless }10wt.{\%} SDS) resulted in isotropic fluid solutions, but for a molar ratio [SDS]/[Al(NO3)3] lower than 6.7:1, precipitation occurred. The precipitate was resolubilized by further addition of aluminum salt ({\textgreater }5wt.{\%} Al(NO3)3). Using the time-resolved fluorescence quenching method and employing pyrene- decylpyridinium chloride as probe-quencher pair, the aggregation numbers and fluorescence quenching rates for spherical micelles were determined. Fluorescence measurements give evidence for different kind of micelles in the two isotropic areas investigated. At low aluminum salt concentration, the micelles are relatively small, but larger than in the absence of salt. At high enough salt concentrations, the precipitate is resolubilized into long rod-like micelles. The strong viscoelastic properties in the linear regime supported the presence of worm-like micelles in the redissolution area. {\copyright } 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

The microstructure of the formed wormlike micelles has been ascertained by transmission electronic microscopy and H-1 NMR technology. The effects of the surfactant concentration, added salt, temperature and different counterions on the viscoelastic solutions have been systematically investigated. In a salt-free state, the eta(0) and R(16)HTAB concentrations obey the relationship of the power law, i.e. eta(0) proportional to C-2.53, in the examined concentration range. The addition of NaSal greatly promoted the micellar growth in R(16)HTAB aqueous solution and resulted in the generation of wormlike micelles.

 abstract = {Molecules or ions which are amphiphilic, i.e. contain at the same time a hydrophilic and a hydrophobic (normally an alkyl chain) part frequently display in aqueous solutions a characteristic strongly cooperative association into colloidal aggregates termed micelles. A general treatment of micellization and related phenomena is given in order to provide an understanding on a molecular level. Hydrophobic interactions are the driving force in micellization but the inclusion of hydrophilic group interactions is required in the thermodynamic description. Intra- and intermicellar electrostatic repulsions are discussed in connection with the changes in micelle shape occuring at higher concentrations or at addition of electrolyte etc. The kinetics of micelle formation is characterized by two greatly different time constants, the rapid one referring to the micelle-monomer exchange and the other to the dissolution and formation of micelles. A large number of physico-chemical methods applicable to the study of micelle formation are surveyed with special emphasis on recent spectroscopic approaches which give a detailed insight into structure, dynamics and interactions. For example, the hydrocarbon chains are characterized by a rapid but slightly hindered motion. The polar head-groups are hydrated while otherwise no appreciable water-amphiphile contact occurs in the micelles. The binding of small counter-ions to micelles of ionic amphiphiles is characterized by a marked specificity affecting both spectroscopic and macroscopic properties. The phenomena of solubilization, mixed micelle formation and micellar catalysis are discussion on a molecular basis as well as the formation of reversed micelles and amphiphile aggregation in non-aqueous media. The biological implications of micelle formation are briefly indicated. {\copyright } 1979.},

 abstract = {The influence of ionic charges on the mesophases in the ternary system of C(12-16)E(6) (LA 070), ethylhexylglycerid (EHG), and water was studied. The charge was introduced by adding the ionic surfactant SDS (sodium dodecyl sulfate). The single lamellar phase (5 wt {\%} LA 070 and 240 mM EHG in water) yields a bluish homogeneous solution. With the addition of SDS, the samples become more and more clear. Rheology measurements indicate that increased charge density increases the storage modulus G', and the lamellar phases show typical behavior of a viscoelastic fluid with a yield stress at higher SDS concentration. SAXS measurements show that the interlamellar distance D decreases with SDS concentration. The addition of ionic surfactants suppresses the Helfrich undulations, flattens the bilayers, and decreases interbilayer spacing due to electrostatic repulsions of the ionic surfactant head groups. Furthermore, the L(alpha) phase transforms into vesicle phases as the SDS concentration is increased. Second, it is shown that with added NaCl electrolyte the phase with charged surfactant behaves again in the same way as the initial uncharged system. The addition of salt screens the electrostatic interaction, which leads to a higher flexibility of the bilayers and a decrease of the storage modulus G'. Theoretical calculations show that the shear moduli of the L(alpha) phases are much smaller than the osmotic pressure of the systems. Several models are proposed for the explanation of the shear moduli. The model due to Lekkerkerker for the electric contribution of the bending constant of the bilayer seems to yield good results for the transition to vesicles.},
